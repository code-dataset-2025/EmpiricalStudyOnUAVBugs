**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** Not explicitly mentioned
- **Software environment:** PX4 Autopilot, presumed version linked to the log file date or mentions.
- **Report Time:** May 13, 2019
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Not mentioned
- **last commit before the reporting time:**f067ca0

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Follow instructions for system-wide replay (not EKF2 replay) from the PX4 documentation.
- **Step 2:** Set the logfile path export `replay=~/<path>/41b1370f-0007-4537-b245-2fe3344e4f69.ulg`.
- **Step 3:** Run `make px4_sitl_default jmavsim`.

**Observed behavior by the user:**

- **Behavior after step 1:** Initial options parsing and simulation startup.
- **Behavior after step 2:** Parameters from ULog file applied.
- **Behavior after step 3:** Multiple errors and warnings in terminal output related to mismatched formats and sensor failures, culminating in a floating-point exception.

**Expected behavior:**
- **Expected behavior 1:** Successful execution of system-wide replay without errors.
- **Expected behavior 2:** Sensor outputs and status formats should match without causing exceptions or crashes during execution.

**Additional information provided by the user for bug investigation:**
- **Actions taken by the user:** Performed clean build without lockstep enabled, attempted running with local files and configurations.
- **URL of the flight log provided by the user:** https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=41b1370f-0007-4537-b245-2fe3344e4f69<font color='red'>因为这个文件已经不存在，无法进行复现步骤的第二步</font>

**Communication between developers or other personnel and the user:**

- **Suggestion 1 provided by developers or other personnel:** Julianoes suggested potential lockstep issue and trying a clean build.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 1:** No change; the issue persisted even without lockstep.
- **Suggestion 2 provided by developers or other personnel:** Dagar emphasized the need for automated testing to detect similar issues.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 2:** Not directly addressed by the user.
- **Suggestion 3 provided by developers or other personnel:** bkueng asked for running with GDB for detailed stack trace.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 3:** User provided GDB output indicating arithmetic exception due to a division operation with a zero variable. 

The issue was not actively resolved but was hinted to be related to user-specific configuration which led to it being marked resolved unless encountered again.
