Here is the detailed output for the provided PX4 Autopilot bug report:

---

**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** Not explicitly mentioned
- **Software environment:** PX4 Autopilot, commit version 156cf16
- **Report Time:** Feb 14, 2020
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Commit 156cf16

---

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Conduct hardware tests as part of the CI process.<font color='red'>硬件检查CI process</font>
- **Step 2:** Observe the occurrence of a hardfault during the tests.
- **Step 3:** Despite the hardfault, the CI hardware check does not fail and reports a pass.

---

**Observed behavior by the user:**

- **Behavior after step 1:** Tests begin as part of the CI process.
- **Behavior after step 2:** Hardware tests fail due to a hardfault.
- **Behavior after step 3:** The CI system incorrectly reports the hardware test as passing.

---

**Expected behavior:**

- **Expected behavior 1:** The CI hardware check should fail when a hardfault occurs.
- **Expected behavior 2:** The hardware test should validate CPU load, driver initialization, RAM usage, and hardfault detection.
- **Expected behavior 3:** The test should incorporate mechanisms to scrape the shell output for error or failure messages and analyze system metrics like `top` for issues.

---

**Additional information provided by the user for bug investigation:**

- **Actions taken by the user:** Suggested adding mechanisms to analyze shell output for error or failure messages and to include system monitoring tools like `top`.
- **URL of the flight log provided by the user:** Not provided.

---

**Communication between developers or other personnel and the user:**

- **Suggestion 1 provided by developers or other personnel:** The issue was fixed in the CI process by exiting from failed hardware checks with an error to ensure the check fails (commit reference #14215).
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 1:** The CI system correctly fails on hardware faults after the fix.
