- **URL of the flight log provided by the user:** Not provided.

**Communication between developers or other personnel and the user:**

- **Suggestion 1 provided by developers or other personnel:** Developer `dagar` identified the issue as the cast align warning (-Werror=cast-align) and suggested updating the build and CI system.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 1:** No direct results as it is more of a suggestion for future action rather than an immediate workaround.

- **Suggestion 2 provided by developers or other personnel:** Developer `julianoes` suggested removing -Werror from a specific file to work around the warning temporarily.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 2:** Not explicitly mentioned, but the issue remained open until it was automatically marked as stale due to inactivity, suggesting the workaround may have been incomplete or not implemented.

- **Suggestion n provided by developers or other personnel:** Issue marked stale and closed by automation due to lack of activity.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion n:** Issue closed without further action.
