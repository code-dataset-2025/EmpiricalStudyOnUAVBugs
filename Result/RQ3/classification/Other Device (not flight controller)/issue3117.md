**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** Not explicitly mentioned
- **Software environment:** Not explicitly mentioned
- **Report Time:** Nov 2, 2015
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Not mentioned
- **last commit before the reporting time:**484bd3b

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Use the PX4 Autopilot software on the runway_takeoff_before branch with a mixer that has 8 channels assigned.
- **Step 2:** Power cycle the setup multiple times, potentially with different connected peripherals like a receiver and servos. <font color='red'>实际上需要mixed 、receiver and servos</font>
- **Step 3:** Observe the behavior when peripherals like receivers are connected versus when they're not.

**Observed behavior by the user:**

- **Behavior after step 1:** Random mixer load errors are encountered.
- **Behavior after step 2:** Errors occur intermittently depending on connected peripherals.
- **Behavior after step 3:** Mixer load seems to fail more frequently with everything wired up, sometimes resulting in mixer load errors.

**Expected behavior:**

- **Expected behavior 1:** The mixer should load without errors regardless of connected peripherals.
- **Expected behavior 2:** The system should initialize correctly on every boot without failure.

**Additional information provided by the user for bug investigation:**

- **Actions taken by the user:** 
  - Removed lines from the mixer to isolate the issue.
  - Attempted booting with the safety switch held down to force an upgrade.
  - Experimented with connecting various modules and observed their impact on the issue.
  - Provided an `IO status` for both working and non-working scenarios for diagnostic purposes.
  - Reproduced the issue with minimal and full setups with different hardware configurations and receiver types.
  - Noted that the error seemed related to an on-boot condition related to connected receivers.

**Communication between developers or other personnel and the user:**

- **Suggestion 1 provided by developers or other personnel:** Hold down the safety switch during boot to potentially force an upgrade.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 1:** Did not help in resolving the issue.
  
- **Suggestion 2 provided by developers or other personnel:** The user should cut the signal wire to see if the problem persists.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 2:** The issue didn’t occur without the signal pin of the FrSky, sbus receiver but later failed with a Graupner receiver as well.

- **Suggestion 3 provided by developers or other personnel:** Provided guidance on reproducing the bug for further investigation.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 3:** The user was able to provide details on reproducing the issue, noting it was a rare and inconsistent issue exacerbated under certain hardware configurations.

- **Suggestion 4 provided by developers or other personnel:** Developers recommended against flying with the identified setup due to the risk of unknown issues.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 4:** The user maintained a cautious approach by documenting setups that reproduced the issue, contributing to further investigation and issue resolution.
