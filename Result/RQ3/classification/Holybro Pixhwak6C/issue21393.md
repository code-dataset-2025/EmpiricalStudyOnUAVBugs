Sure, let's break down the information from the document about the PX4 Autopilot issue:

**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** Pixhawk v6c board, PX4 Vision Autonomy Development Kit.
- **Software environment:** Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS with ROS 2 Humble, PX4 Autopilot v1.13.3 and latest main branch.
- **Report Time:** March 29, 2023.
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Not mentioned.
- **last commit before the reporting time:**932b743

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Follow the PX4-Autopilot ROS 2 User Guide, including installing ROS 2 Humble, building PX4-msgs, PX4-ros-com, and Micro XRCE DDS Agent in ROS within ROS 2 Workspace.
- **Step 2:** Clone PX4-Autopilot and build px4_fmu-v6c (`make px4_fmu-v6c`).
- **Step 3:** Open QGroundControl and upload custom board firmware.
- **Step 4:** Start the `microdds_client` on the PX4 board using the command `microdds_client start -t serial -d /dev/ttyS3 -b 921600`.
- **Step 5:** Connect TELEM2 to the computer by serial.
- **Step 6:** Launch the Micro XRCE DDS Agent on the computer with `MicroXRCEAgent serial -b 921600 --dev /dev/ttyUSB0`.

**Observed behavior by the user:**

- **Behavior after step 4:** The microdds_client is running but remains disconnected.
- **Behavior after step 6:** The Micro XRCE DDS Agent does not establish a connection with the PX4 board.

**Expected behavior:**

- **Expected behavior 1:** The computer's Micro XRCE DDS Agent connects to the PX4 Micro DDS Client and creates ROS2 publishers/subscribers.

**Additional information provided by the user for bug investigation:**

- **Actions taken by the user:** Tried both PX4 Autopilot v1.13.3 and the latest main branch, adjusted XRCE_DDS_0_CFG to TELEM2, encountered issues with parameter persistence, attempted launching sequences in different orders, checked for processes occupying ports.

**Communication between developers or other personnel and the user:**

- **Suggestion 1 provided by developers or other personnel:** Mr. Pollo suggested trying with the v1.14-beta2 release tag.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 1:** The same error occurred, but additional log outputs were generated.
- **Suggestion 2 provided by developers or other personnel:** Beniamin Pozzan questioned if the right serial port and availability were ensured and suggested trying a fresh beta2 firmware.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 2:** User discovered MAVLink was using the same ports, disabling MAVLink on TELEM2 resolved the issue.

- The user also discovered that preventing QGroundControl from using the TELEM2 port resolved the issue with the Micro XRCE DDS Agent.
- The final resolution included disabling MAVLink on TELEM2, enabling Micro XRCE-DDS on the port, and ensuring the correct baud rate, which allowed the system to function correctly by boot.
