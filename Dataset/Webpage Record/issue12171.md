Describe the bug    
The issue extensively described in    
\\\#12001 (comment)    
and point 5. of \\\#12014 (comment)    
is still existent on VTOLs (also in the release 1.9).  
To Reproduce    
Reproducable in SITL with the Deltawing  
1.Start simulation with joystick configured  
2.When GPS is locked but it's still in Manual mode from bootup hold throttle stick high and switch to position mode.  
3.Let go of the stick and let it center  
4.Arm and the vehicle goes up without smooth takeoff and possibly detects landing even though it should idle  
Expected behavior    
Point 4. above.  
Drone (please complete the following information):  
- problem found on a real VTOL with pixhawk 4 and almost unchanged 1.9 stable flashed  
Additional context    
1c776f1 fixes this problem for multicopters and I did extensive testing on multicopter platforms but didn't know that VTOL seems to work differently and apparently doesn't go though this part of the code.  
FYI @RomanBapst @sfuhrer
