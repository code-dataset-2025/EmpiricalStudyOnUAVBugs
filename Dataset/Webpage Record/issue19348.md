Describe the bug    
The simple MAVSDK takeoff and land example does not work properly anymore, that is, it only works once, then it refuses to arm saying "Mode not suitable for takeoff" as it is in Land mode.    
This used to work and is very confusing.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Start SITL  
2.Try https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python/blob/main/examples/takeoff_and_land.py with latest mavsdk from pip installed.  
3.Run it once.  
4.Run it again.

@julianoes @Czw007 Does \\\#19449 not hotfix/unblock this issue? At least for the case you're in land mode after landing. We need an automatic switch to keep being compatible to the arm and then switch mode workflow. I still suggest changing the workflow to first switch the mode and then arm in the future or possibly making it atomic in the state machine in further future.
