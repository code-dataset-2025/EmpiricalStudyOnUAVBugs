I just tried build px4 master branch for beaglebone_blue and get this error:    
-Werror=cast-align  
To Reproduce    
make beaglebone_blue_cross    
using tool and lib:    
-gcc-linaro-7.4.1-2019.02-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf    
-librobotcontrol_1.0.4  
get error:    
librobotcontrol -> include/rc/mavlink/common/../protocol.h:280:49: error: cast from ‘const char*’ to ‘const uint16_t* {aka const short unsigned int*}’ increases required alignment of target type [-Werror=cast-align]  
fix with -Wno-cast-align

We need to get Beaglebone into the CI system.  
@teknokita you can fix this by ignoring the warning (-Wno-cast-align) on a per module/driver basis.  
Example: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/0b548fa6849e7a608b4c120fb66a760e51806056/src/drivers/distance_sensor/sf1xx/CMakeLists.txt\\\#L37

@dagar we do now have a beaglebone in CI, right?
