There seems to be a regression for offboard control since 1.9. Starting offboard control, so switching the mode to offboard control does no longer work.  
Offboard control gets rejected:  
    
```bash     
 [03:37:30|Warn ] command temporarily rejected (176). (mavlink_commands.cpp:168)        
/home/julianoes/src/MAVSDK/src/integration_tests/offboard_attitude.cpp:83: Failure        
Expected equality of these values:        
  offboard->start()        
    Which is: 4-byte object <05-00 00-00>        
  Offboard::Result::SUCCESS        
    Which is: 4-byte object <01-00 00-00>        
```  
To Reproduce  
Run the MAVSDK integration test against jMAVSim SITL:  
    
```bash     
 cmake -Bbuild -H. && cmake --build build -j8 && build/src/integration_tests/integration_tests_runner --gtest_filter="SitlTest.OffboardAttitudeRate"        
```

git bisect points to 3faab90!  
@dagar any idea how this happened?

No, but I'll look into it. We should really get these tests running against PX4/Firmware directly.

What are the general requirements of offboard control mode? Is it expected that you start streaming some type of offboard setpoint prior to changing modes?

Exactly, you need to have an offboard setpoint set before you can switch to the mode.
