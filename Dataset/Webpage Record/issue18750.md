Describe the bug    
@priseborough was setting up a flying wing on master and was asking me how to calibrate the servos specifically why there are no PWM_MAIN_TRIMx parameters while there are PWM_AUX_TRIMx parameters.  
Additional context    
I did a quick debug and am pretty sure it is a race condition were the mixers are not loaded yet when the first parameter update is done. So the condition that was added here prevents the parameters from being discovered:

I tested and after changing a parameter and reloading the ground station while the autopilot is still running I can see the parameters.  
I'll create a pr to remove it but I'm not sure about side effects. @dagar would be nice if you could check.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Flash pixhawk 4 with latest master (2021-11-30 01db98f)  
2.Boot with an airframe e.g. quad_x 4001  
3.Look for parameters named PWM_MAIN_TRIMx in the editor  
4.See all the PWM_MAIN_{DISx,FAILx,MAXx,MINx,REVx} but no TRIMs  
Expected behavior    
PWM_MAIN and PWM_AUX should offer the same parameter set.
