There are a few strange things that would require further investigations:  
- The mag data already stops before takeoff (are you sure you only stopped it during landing?)  
- The GNSS vel/pos fusion only seem to start after the mag data stopped  
- When the GNSS fusion resets, it has a huge value (was the origin incorrect?)  
- The position setpoint isn't exactly adjusted during the reset. It could be a race condition because it looks like the EKF selector switches at the same time.

The issue in this log is not compass loss, it is an invalid GPS message that results in the EKF resetting it's position to a 0 lat,lon.
