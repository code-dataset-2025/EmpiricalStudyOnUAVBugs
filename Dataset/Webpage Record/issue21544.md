Describe the bug  
We had a crash with our hexacopter ðŸ˜­ using PX4 v1.13.2 . In Position mode, the drone started to turn on itself and it was impossible to take the control back... The only thing I see in the log is the loss of RTK to DGNSS at that time but nothing else. Is it possible that this loss of RTK caused this kind of behavior ?  
But even if I loose RTK, I don't understand why the drone started to spin as the heading of our drone is defined by the magnetometer  
Thank you for all the help you can give me !

I tried to look deeper to the log. Actually I'm not sure the loss of RTK is related at all to the crash. From what I understand, at 15:46 the drone stop to follow Yaw input from pilot and start to have continuous setpoint in one direction... The loss of RTK only happen at 16:03 when the drone already touch the ground.  
Also to mention, I had an error message of type "Critical: Mag timeout error". We recalibrate the compass once but the error was still there so we change the Holybro M8N and recalibrate the compass again. Now I regret we did not took more care of this error...  
@bresch could you confirm my observation ? Any advice why this error happen and what can be done to fix it ?

I did some tests without propellers.

Why this message is showing here and how to solve it ?  
    
```bash

It looks like it was a short circuit between two wires of the external magnetometer. Changing the cable seems to fix the issue. I'll reopen if error is back even with the new cable

Well actually it is not fixed by changing the cable. We armed more than 30 times (without propellers) before the issue happens again...

Conclusion was that the motors were not tight enough. So one motor move and implied the spinning of the drone
