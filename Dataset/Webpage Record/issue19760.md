Describe the bug  
Divide by zero in VehicleIMU::ParametersUpdate method in VehicleIMU.cpp when IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX is set to zero.  This causes the estimator to fail and complete loss of control of drone!  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Fixed-wing drone with v1.13.0-alpha1-4403-g5717434e93 software  
2.IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX set to zero (default in QGroundControl)  
3.Takeoff  
4.Trigger VehicleIMU::ParametersUpdate method by changing a parameter  
5.Complete loss of control of drone  
Expected behavior  
Divide macro which checks for zero before dividing!  
Log Files and Screenshots  
VehicleIMU::ParametersUpdate method annotated:    
QGroundControl defaults IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX to zero for fixed-wing vehicles:

Drone:  
- Fixed-wing drone  
- QGroundControl defaults  
- PX4-Autopilot v1.13.0-alpha1-4403-g5717434e93 software

Sorry to hear about the crash. Within VehicleIMU the actual intervals are calculated from actual data publication rates, so I think it might be easier to skip the IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX constraint in the first place. The IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX default is no longer 0.  
Can you review \\\#19765?
