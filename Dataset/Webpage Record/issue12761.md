Describe the bug    
When GF_ACTION is "Hold" and there's a geofence violation while the drone is in Hold-reposition (QGroundControl click on map and "Go to location"), the drone continues to the commanded location which is outside the geofence.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Set GF_ACTION to Hold (Loiter).  
2.Upload a geofence to the drone.  
3.Takeoff, click somewhere outside the geofence (or inside if it's a keep-out fence) and select "Go to location".  
4.Observe the drone violating the geofence and continuing to the destination position.  
Expected behavior    
The drone must reposition to the closest location on the geofence border, even if it's already in Hold/Loiter mode! Simply switching to Hold/Loiter isn't enough.

Hello @superware ,    
Actually there was no problem with GF_ACTION when I tested with real flight.  
Can you check GF_COUNT parameter to sure about problem is related to PX4 stack.  
    
GF_COUNT    
Geofence counter limitComment:Â Set how many subsequent position measurements outside of the fence are needed before geofence violation is triggered

Hello @bozkurthan ,

Did you try to violate the geofence while already in Hold (repositioning to another location)? This is easily reproducible with SITL.  
    
Can you check GF_COUNT parameter to sure about problem is related to PX4 stack.    
GF_COUNT: -1, I am using PX4.

Thanks for the issue. This sounds like the implementation is broken for this case.

Nope, you are right I just tried with manual mode.    
I reproduced this behavior.  
GF_ACTION    
Fence limit    
Violation by using "Go to Location"

This has been fixed in the meantime (double actually: there is a check that doesn't allow you to set a goto outside of the fence, and upon hitting the fence the vehicle would now stop there).
