I believe this is a bug with the icm20948 driver, which up until recently was using an incorrect device id. I'll try to reproduce.

Is it fixed yet??  
Tried building the source for px4_fmu-v3_default and faced faced the same problem with latest v1.10.0-rc1.    
Installing v1.10.0 Beta 4 using QGC also had the same problem.  
Then, tried building v1.10.0-rc1 for another hardware with px4_fmu-v5_default, didn't face that problem though.

I'm facing a similar issue with Here2 compass on a pixhawk 4 board.    
That seems to confirm the bug is related to ICM20948 driver.

I can't reproduce anymore this issue on current stable version.    
Tested on both Pixhawk v3 and v5 autopilot, equipped with an Here 2 antenna.    
Is that been fixed?

It's possible that this has been fixed by \\\#14345, if the issue was in regards to external UAVCAN compasses.
