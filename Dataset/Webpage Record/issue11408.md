Today we tested Master v1.9.0 (beta) (7f3b170) with the Pixracer, Pixhawk 4 mini, Pixhawk 4. Created mission. The vehicle armed good, took off. At 30 meters the vehicle started spinning and came down to the ground. Resulted in a crash. Same behavior for all 3 platforms.  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Uploaded mission  
2.Drone switched on  
3.Vehicle armed  
4.Took off  
5.Elevated to 30 meters  
6.vehicle started spinning out of control  
7.The vehicle came down and crashed

In both cases (fmu-v4 and fmu-v5) the pc points to math::max (mathlib/math/Limits.hpp:72) called from navigator MissionBlock::get_time_inside().

I think the problem is passing the reference of a packed struct (mission_item) member to the template function. Taking a closer look...

This is easy enough to fix once off, but I'm looking for a most exhaustive solution (compiler warning perhaps) otherwise we'll need to be careful around anything packed (mission items, mavlink in general).

Newer gcc has -Waddress-of-packed-member.

We need to do a quick pass of packed structure usage looking for anything that might take the address of a  member, create a reference, or pass it into a function that does.  
This includes navigator (mission_item), mavlink (anything from the mavlink spec), and a few drivers.
