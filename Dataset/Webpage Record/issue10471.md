Problem:    
After doing a make clean simulation works. It does not work anymore if you try to run it a second time without a make clean in between. This time it will go wild right after arming.  
Steps to reproduce  
    
```bash     
 make clean        
make posix_sitl_default gazebo_standard_vtol        
```  
quit the app  
make posix_sitl_default gazebo_standard_vtol  
arm the drone and see it going wild
