Through the console (serial or mavlink) could you run ver all? The build for older pixhawks that are limited to using the 1st MB of flash only (px4fmu-v2) don't have UAVCAN included. If you have one of the newer chips you can flash the px4fmu-v3 build which contains UAVCAN and more optional peripheral drivers..

Unfortunately I have the px4fmu-v2 one. Anything I can do here?

You can build a custom binary (nuttx_px4fmu-v2_default). You'll need to uncomment uavcan here https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/cmake/configs/nuttx_px4fmu-v2_default.cmake\\\#L111, but also comment out other drivers and modules you won't be using to make it fit.

Hi Dan,    
just investigated a little further.    
First itÂ´s a chinese clone board, so ver all gives    
So it says the hardware is V2, whereas the MCU is rev.3. According to https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/errata_sheet/38/e6/37/64/08/38/45/67/DM00068628.pdf/files/DM00068628.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00068628.pdf, section 2.2.10, this is fixed for MCU starting with rev 3.

If you upgrade the bootloader you should be good to go. With a slightly newer bootloader QGC flashing can detect the available flash and choose either px4fmu-v2 or px4fmu-v3.  
Recently support was added for doing this on the board itself via parameter. \\\#10426    
The other option is to build and flash the Bootloader yourself, but you need a jtag/swd debugger. https://github.com/PX4/Bootloader
