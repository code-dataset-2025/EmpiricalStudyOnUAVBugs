Describe the bug    
When running the "listener" command on the PX4 shell, it sometimes shows "never published" for topics that have absolutely been published. This happens when using the -n or -r arguments and NOT -i. Below are some examples (with the topic data removed, for brevity):  
    
```bash     
 nsh> listener vehicle_attitude        
  [correct topic data]        
nsh> listener vehicle_attitude -i 0        
  [correct topic data]        
nsh> listener vehicle_attitude -i 0 -n 2        
  [correct topic data twice]        
nsh> listener vehicle_attitude -n 2        
never published        
nsh> listener vehicle_attitude -n 2 -r 2        
never published        
```  
This behavior is the same in SITL.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Choose a topic that has been published (Run uorb top to find some such topics)  
2.Run the command listener <topic> and listener <topic> -i 0 -n 10 and observe correct behavior  
3.Run the command listener <topic> -n 10 and observe never published.
