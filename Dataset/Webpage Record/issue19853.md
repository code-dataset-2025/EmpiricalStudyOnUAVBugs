Describe the bug  
On a clean setup using the Typhoon H480 in a SITL I cannot arm the drone because I get a pre-flight error: Accel Range, hold still on arming  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Run a docker container using jonasvautherin/px4-gazebo-headless with Typhoon H480 & baylands (I've tried with PX4 versions: 1.12 and 1.13) - -v typhoon_h480 -w baylands  
2.Connect to the drone using e.g. QGroundControl  
3.Arm the drone  
4.Pre-flight check error will appear: [PreFlightCheck] Preflight Fail: Accel Range, hold still on arming  
Expected behavior  
SITL would work out of the box.

This issue is caused by the image itself - jonasvautherin/px4-gazebo-headless when a non-existing world is used. Using the empty world works just fine, I don't know why the image does not contain baylands but I hope this is useful to someone ðŸ˜ƒ
