Describe the bug    
Pixhawk 2.1 (Cube) and HERE GPS have inconsistent magnetometers.  
The HERE GPS has a 180° rotation and the Pixhawk 2.1 has a 90° rotation.  
I confirm that the HERE GPS is monted with the arrow aligned with the Pixhawk 2.1 Cube arrow.  
I performed the exact same test on an IRIS+ and the arrow was correctly pointing towards the physical location.  
To Reproduce for External Mag (HERE)    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Enable only the external mag (CAL_MAG0_EN = Enabled, Disabled MAG1, MAG2, MAG3)  
2.Set the CAL_MAG_PRIME parameter to the CAL_MAG0_ID  
3.Point the copter towards a physical direction (or north)  
4.Check the computed north location  
5.Observe an offset between 120 and 180° for MAG0.  
To Reproduce for Internal MAG (Cube)  
1.Enable only the MAG1, MAG2, MAG3  
2.Set the CAL_MAG_PRIME parameter to the CAL_MAGX_ID  
3.Point the copter towards a physical direction (or north)  
4.Check the computed north location  
5.Observe an offset around 90° for all internal MAGs.  
Screenshots  
For the external mag (HERE GPS): The physical orientation is towards B&B Dr. Vee  
For all internal mags (Cube): The physical orientation is towards B&B Dr. Vee

Can you verify which sensor is in your particular Here GPS? My understanding is that it's changed over time.  
Could you run listener across all mags?  
    
```bash     
     listener sensor_mag -i 0    
```  
Repeat for instance (-i) 1, 2, 3.

The HERE GPS is the MAG0 and stayed MAG0, I checked it by disconnecting the HERE and it says MAG0 timeout

This is an hmc5883 and correctly marked as external.  
This line is suspect - https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/ROMFS/px4fmu_common/init.d/rc.sensors\\\#L166-L167

We are experiencing issues with the headings reported by the internal magnetometers on the cube, so was interested by this article as it provides some debugging tips. However the sensor_mag command doesn't seem to work in the same way as per the posts so was hoping you wouldn't mind giving some clues as of why:  
We are using Pixhawk 2.1 and Firmware 1.8.0  
The command seems to ignore the flags -i X  
    
```bash     
 NuttShell (NSH)        
nsh> listener sensor_mag -i 3        
never published        
nsh> listener sensor_mag -i 2        
nsh> listener sensor_mag -i 1        
nsh> listener sensor_mag -i 0        
nsh> listener sensor_mag

@dagar Pitcture of the GPS mounting on the board. Front is aligned with the arrow you see in the background.  
The magnetometer is showing an offset of 180° once computed on the Pixhawk.  
@ealdaz This command works fine for me, I am using NSH from QGC.

Could it simply be a wrong driver due to the many versions available?  
ArduPilot/ardupilot\\\#6633 (comment)  
    
```bash     
 In a standard first revision here, there is a HMC5983, and an LIS3MDL        
In the Here + an additional MCU9250 as well as the others.        
In future Here and here plus units, only a single ICM20948 is fitted due to both the LIS3MDL and the HMC5983 being EOL.        
In the 2.0 cube... (by 3DR) there is a HMC5983 on SPI, and an LSM303D        
In the 2.1 cube... (ProfiCNC/Hex) there are two MPU9250's, and the LSM303D        
```  
Lower, it also says:  
    
```bash     
 Once the problem occurs, rebooting ardupilot (on the flight controller) does not resolve the problem, only powering down the flight controller resolves it.        
```  
I was indeed rebooting with max 2 seconds without power and using reboot command.

Could be this: 1k between 5V and GND to solve a brownout issue on the compass of the HERE.  
Will not solve the 90° of the Cube2.1  
Later in the same post: ArduPilot/ardupilot\\\#6633 (comment)  
    
```bash     
 The newer HERE units with the ICM20948 compass require ROTATION_PITCH_180_YAW_90. I think HEREs shipped after October have the new compass in them, but I'm not 100% on that time frame. But anyway, if you have the newer one, and you are forcing it to orientation 0, then it would never work properly.        
```

The Z magnetometer shows a negative value for the HERE magnetometer. That one should be positive

Same here with Pixhawk4 and GPS Module which is provided in pack. I have disabled internal mag.  
i have got a yaw problem in manual flight, where it turns ccw : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=374cafc0-6b92-4e57-87d2-0750f0ab03b6    
is it depending on this problem?

In the 2.1 cube... (ProfiCNC/Hex) there are two MPU9250's, and the LSM303D    
I leave a comment to just confirm an info about the types of IMU in Pixhawk2.1 (Cube) because it is hard to find the exact info about its IMUs.  
According to the info above (from the Ardupilot github) and my software check and analysis, the installed IMUs on Pixhawk2.1 (Cube) are as following:  
1st IMU: MPU9250 for accel, gyro and mag    
2nd IMU: L3GD20 for gyro and LSM303D for accel and mag    
3rd IMU: MPU9250 for accel, gyro and mag  
Particularly, there are two MPU9250.
