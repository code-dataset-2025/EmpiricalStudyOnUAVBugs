Describe the bug    
Auto modes land and rtl cause quad to fly directly towards home lat/lon/alt. This is the third time I've seen this in two weeks. I've seen it ~10 times since the introduction of FlightTasks. We are flying ~7 hours a week, so this is a very rare edge case bug. Logging either dies completely or drops out when this happens. I finally have a partial log (2 minute long dropout) of a flight where this happened.  
To Reproduce  
1.Takeoff using mode takeoff  
2.Fly around in position mode  
3.Issue land or rtl  
4.This behavior will persist through a land/disarm/arm/takeoff

Additional context    
I am pretty sure takeoff is causing the bug. I am fairly certain navigator gets stuck in a loop somewhere, this would explain the logger dropouts due to thread starvation (navigator priority is higher than logger). I am guessing all auto modes will cause this, we only use land and rtl, but both of those modes do the same thing, fly right towards home.

I missed the comment about logging dying when you described this earlier. Does that happen 100%?

@bkueng any thoughts on the logger dropout?

@dagar This is the first time we have gotten a log from a flight with this bug. All of the other flights where this bug popped up the log has either been missing completely, the file is corrupted, or the log just ends immediately after takeoff.

This is absurdly high.    
logger_sd_write: 142 events, 127853464us elapsed, 900376.51us avg, min 10us max 123208838us 10338323.000us rms  
Compared to another random good log from you.

logger_sd_write has pretty much the same max loop time as navigator (70ms difference)

Can you try with a different SD card? Which one are you using at the moment?

We're using https://www.oempcworld.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=500303&Store_Code=oem&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsYGl252k3QIVnEwNCh1RlgSFEAYYASABEgLFSvD_BwE  
I can get a different SD card and test this... Are you thinking maybe navigator is attempting to read a mission that isn't there or something of that nature?

Haven't seen this since September, FlightTasks has seen lots of good work since then. Closing this.
