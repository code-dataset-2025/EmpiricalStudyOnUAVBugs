Describe the bug    
In a VTOL mission with the last waypoint being a land waypoint and the previous ones being navigated as fixed wing, the expectation is that the vehicle transitions before reaching the land waypoint and only starts descending when horizontally reaching the land waypoint.    
However, on latest master the vehicle executes the transition and after it's completion immediately starts descending, even if it hasn't gotten close to the land waypoint.  
To Reproduce    
In SITL (use standard vtol model) plan a mission using a VTOL takeoff item, a couple of way waypoints and lastly add a land waypoint. Due to the excessive drag of the gazebo model the vehicle will finish the transition back to hover well before it has gotten close to the land waypoint. However, you will see that while moving to the land waypoint for the landing it will start descending as well.  
Expected behavior    
The vehicle should finish the back-transition, move to the landing waypoint while maintaining altitude and only start descending once the land waypoint has been reached.
