Describe the bug    
The SD card does not mount on a Pixhawk 4. Unable to determine if this is a software issue or hardware.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Upload v1.8.2 stock firmware on pixhawk 4  
2.power cycle autopilot with the stock 4GB SD card  
3.Connect Qground control  
4.See if SD card is mounted using the mount command on nsh. Only /etc and /proc is mounted. /fs/microsd is not mounted  
5.Trying to mount the SD card using mount -t vfat /dev/mmcsd0 /mnt/fs crashes pixhawk  
Expected behavior    
The SD card should be mounted. mount command on NSH should return the /fs/microsd as a mounted directory.    
Alternatively, if this is a hardware problem with the pixhawk 4, there needs to be a way to identify and isolate this. Verified that the SD card works with a different pixhawk 4.  
Log Files and Screenshots    
No log files are available since SD card can  
Add screenshots to help explain your problem.  
Drone (please complete the following information):    
Not mounted on a drone yet  
Alternative approaches tried to debug the issue:  
1.Uploaded master and beta branches to pixhawk 4. This however prevented the pixhawk from booting up.

Can you try with a different SD card?  
That said, attempting to mount should never crash the flight controller.

Which version of master was this. Can you try again and paste the git hash here?

 Collision prevention improvements (\\\\\#11866)          
* match max vel in col-prev to regular pos ctrl          
* change warning criterium to avoid float error          
* disable push back from obstacles          
* use floats consistently          
```    
The behavior on this version is that pixhawk doesn't boot if sd card(empty one) is inserted into pixhawk.    
IO Led status:  
- PWR : on continous  
- B/E : on continous  
- ACT : blinking ~2hz  
FMU Led status:  
- PWR : on continous  
- B/E : off  
- ACT : off  
Boots if there is no SD card.

How is the SD card formatted that you are trying to use?

It is fat32 formatted. I've tried other sd cards with fat32 formatting

Sounds like faulty hardware, not sure what to do about it. If you have a Dronecode debug probe (or something similar) you could get the startup output.

@julianoes : We found a way to get the debug probe and attaching the files here.

@echoGee - I would try curren master. If it does not run, and does not boot the px4io, nor mounts the SD card, I would say it is a HW problem and you should contact Holybro.
