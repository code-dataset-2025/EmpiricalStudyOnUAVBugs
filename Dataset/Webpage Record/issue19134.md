Describe the bug    
ICM-20649 IMU measurements (both accel and gyro) contain several glitches when IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX is set to 250 Hz on v1.12.3 (fmu-v5x).    
The issue does not show up when IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX is set to larger values (e.g. with 400 Hz there is no issue).  
To Reproduce  
- Flash v1.12.3 stable  
- From QGC reset parameters to default  
- Set IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX to 250 Hz  
- Reboot  
- From the nsh console run icm20649 status. Several errors show up.  
- Log sensor_gyro_0 and sensor_accel_0 for a minute. Check that glitches appear on both gyro and accel (with the autopilot fixed on ground).  
    
```bash     
 nsh> icm20649 status        
INFO  [SPI_I2C] Running on SPI Bus 3        
INFO  [icm20649] FIFO empty interval: 3555 us (281.3 Hz)        
icm20649: bad register: 0 events        
icm20649: bad transfer: 62 events        
icm20649: FIFO empty: 0 events        
icm20649: FIFO overflow: 5871 events        
icm20649: FIFO reset: 5872 events        
icm20649: DRDY missed: 0 events        
```  
Expected behavior    
The IMU measurements are expected to contain no glitches/discontinuities. It is expected that running icm20649 status shows no errors. The gyros should read (0,0,0) and accels should read constant (0,0,-g) when fixed on ground.

Thanks @simopanzer89 I'll take a look. The scheduling for the icm20602 and icm42688p is quite nice because we can configure a FIFO watermark interrupt. For some reason the icm20649 doesn't have this feature.  
Can you try with current PX4 master (soon to be v1.13)? The icm20649 scheduling was already adjusted to be a bit more flexible.

Hi @dagar , thanks for the feedback.    
I tested it on the current master (052adfb) and the issue didn't show up at IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX 250.    
Here is the output of the status command on the various IMUs:  
    
```bash

Thanks for testing @simopanzer89, that looks better. Note the icm20649 provides 9000 Hz gyro, 4500 Hz accel, so when you request 250 Hz the actual rate is the nearest FIFO sample multiple. It's also limited by the (somewhat arbitrary) size of the FIFO array in sensor_accel_fifo/sensor_gyro_fifo.   
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/msg/sensor_gyro_fifo.msgLines 11 to 13  
      in052adfb*/int16[32] x \# angular velocity in the FRD board frame X-axis in rad/s int16[32] y \# angular velocity in the FRD board frame Y-axis in rad/s int16[32] z \# angular velocity in the FRD board frame Z-axis in rad/s  
```  
Could you let me know if you have any other issues with current master? We're closing in on a v1.13, so any feedback at this stage really helps. In the meantime if you need an icm20649 fix for v1.12 I can try to point you to the commits to cherry-pick, but we won't be doing another point release at this stage.

Thanks @dagar. I'll let you know if we have further issue with this on master.    
For the time being we decided to set IMU_GYRO_RATEMAX to 400 Hz on v1.12.3, which actually avoids the issue.
