Describe the bug    
Hello,  when changing some parameters like EKF2_AID_MASK we need to reboot controller from QGC. In case of Safety switch in state ARMED propellers are rotating for small time( less than one turn)  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Switch drone into 'ARMING' State using Safety switch button  
2.In QGC go to Params->Tools->Reboot  
3.Wait until controller starts to boot  
4.Propellers will turn for small period of time( corresponds to ~30 degrees)  
Expected behavior    
As proposed solution - is to disarm copter during execution of reboot cmd or disarm during booting  
- Generic quadrotor with Firmware : stable v1.8.2
