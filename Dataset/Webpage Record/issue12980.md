Update: in SITL, with IRIS, it checks out fine, that is, the system responds as expected!  
I am using the Generic Quadrotor X frame. Something I should be careful with? Maybe I should change the yaw gain?  
EDIT: tested on latest master, not the stable version.    
EDIT2: tried to test SITL, but get compass \\#0 uncalibrated immediately once I try to arm the vehicle.    
I will try to flash the latest master and check how it behaves.    
EDIT3: @TSC21 the error regarding ODOM and unconnected trees does not show up in master either, so maybe there is some problem there?

Update: Flying with master does not show the issue! Just successfully flied with mas flashed without any problems. Maybe there was something missing on the v1.9.2 stable...  
Anyhow, I will follow @dagar 's suggestion and add a test for this next week - hopefully before next release.  
EDIT: The successful flight log is on the same google drive, under working-master.

Do a make clean if that happens with SITL, it's an incompatibility of the configuration that requires rebuilding after switching the branch across a certain point.
