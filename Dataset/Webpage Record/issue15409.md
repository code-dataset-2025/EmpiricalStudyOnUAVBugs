Describe the bug    
The VTOL is no longer yawing towards the VTOL Takeoff & Transition waypoint. This causes the mission to fail, triggering RTL (which then itself has a bug).    
@RomanBapst  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Checkout current master (aa7735c)  
2.make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol  
3.Load a mission with a VTOL Takeoff & Transition waypoint, e.g. square vtol.zip  
4.Start the mission and observe.  
Expected behavior    
The drone should yaw towards the waypoint and then transition.

Most recent I have tested is on PR \\\#15034 (June 04). Something in between must have gone wrong.
