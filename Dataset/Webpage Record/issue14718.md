Describe the bug    
During the front transition, the drone rolls into the wrong direction and deviates from the expected path. Observed in SITL, probably linked to \\\#14405 @RomanBapst  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Run SITL: make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol  
2.Launch a mission with a vtol takeoff and transition waypoint  
3.Observe  
Expected behavior    
The drone should face / fly towards the front transition waypoint  
Log Files and Screenshots    
Log file: (transition northwards) https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=af78e5c4-99fc-46fb-924c-c706a9fe6964  
Similar behaviour when transitioning towards East or South:    
Drone (please complete the following information):  
- SITL standard VTOL on Gazebo  
- run on master from 20.04.2020  
Additional context    
Going through the code changes of \\\#14405, I additionally noticed the hard coded limit in https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/809b45eac89cd89cb20a9a5cba646396ef136730/src/modules/vtol_att_control/vtol_type.cpp\\\#L193 that I would prefer to have as a parameter and a comment that should be adapted at https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/809b45eac89cd89cb20a9a5cba646396ef136730/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cpp\\\#L1579 to include the transitions.  
I think there is also a problem with the yaw alignment when the drone initiates the transition. It still rotates at around 45Â°/s in the log shared above. But that's I guess a separate point.
