Describe the bug  
After this commit da4644c, the Jenkins Hardware rack tests were all failing on the main branch, as the "Failsafe Flighttask activated" error was popping up.  
To Reproduce  
Checkout da4644c20adce8aeedd5be432fc88b1b115d7eb9 commit, then: make px4_sitl gazebo-classic -> Soon after startup, "Failsafe Flighttask activated" error will appear  
Expected behavior  
Failsafe flighttask error shouldn't arise.  
Diagnosis  
As da4644c introduced concept of invalidating Sticks object if there's no manual control coming in (makes sense), the "ManualAcceleration" task started failing (as in HITL & SITL, no manual control is provided), and it then falls back to "ManualAltitudeSmoothVel" task:  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/flight_mode_manager/FlightModeManager.cppLines 226 to 229  
      inda4644c*/default : error = switchTask (FlightTaskIndex::ManualAltitudeSmoothVel); break ; }  
```  
That somehow triggered the Failsafe task timeout. I learned a lot during debugging but still don't understand fully to explain what's going on. But @MaEtUgR I think you will be able to identify the root cause more efficiently! ü¶æ  
Log Files and Screenshots  
Additional context  
@dagar I always ignored the Jenkins Hardware rack tests, but this one really showed me that it will actually catch the cases we shouldn't ignore. Let's make sure we catch these in the future before it getting merged as well!!

Note: I have found that before/after that problematic commit, the Flight Task activation pattern has differed.  
After the commit: Switches between 0, 3, 5 indexes (each Auto, ManualAcceleration, ManualAltitudeSmoothVel)    
Before the commit: Switches between 0, 3 indexes (each Auto, ManualAcceleration)  
It is very strange why after that commit the "ManualAltitudeSmoothVel" is suddenly failing to activate/initialize, but at least the problem is getting narrowed down üò¨

Ah no! I realized there's actually *plenty of commits between these two. Idk why Jenkins didn't run (or preserve log) for commits in between, but it now excludes possibility that Alex's commit actually introduced this bug (as it's only related to UAVCAN, it is not likely. The driver isn't even running in the STIL).  
Now investigating all the commits between them üòû

Found it by bisecting 8 times! It's this commit: da4644c

@junwoo091400 Heeey, thanks for looking into this! That's already really helpful. I noticed the Failsafe Flighttask activated in SITL and wanted to see why it comes up in a quiet moment but wasn't aware that it trips CI (a good thing) or someone else found it too.  
Let me check if it's as easy to reproduce as I remember.

It is easy to reproduce üëÄ    
make px4_sitl jmavsim

I added the validity flag to the requirements of using stick input:

Maybe there's a glitch.

It's because it goes through Altitude mode during boot even when there is no stick input and Altitude mode reports to fail üòï

@MaEtUgR Btw I did some analysis (in comments above), feel free to reference them in case that helps as well! üôå  
What I found weird was that FlightTask was trying to activate 3 different tasks (trying to activate Auto, failing then falling back to ManualAcceleration, failing then falling back to ManualAltitudeSmoothVel, etc"  
Is this how Flighttasks are supposed to operate? I was surprised by how many switchTask gets called!!

It's a fallback but Commander always tries to be in NAVIGATION_STATE_AUTO_LOITER from the beginning on but something fails there. I'm guessing because there's no position estimate available yet.

I'm pretty sure now the problem is that with the new failsafe state machine it is allowed to switch to a mode before arming even though it cannot run. When doing so e.g. switching to Hold mode FlightTaskAuto is ran and reports it cannot run because it requires local position, global reference and a position setpoint triplet. So the question is how to solve that best. ü§î    
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/flight_mode_manager/tasks/Auto/FlightTaskAuto.cppLines 97 to 100  
      in319f3db*/// require valid reference and valid target ret = ret && _evaluateGlobalReference () && _evaluateTriplets (); // require valid position ret = ret && _position. isAllFinite () && _velocity. isAllFinite ();  
```

It's a double implementation of checks because historically we couldn't rely on Commander for all cases. Ideally we have this execution status of a mode tie into the state machine directly. For this case now we can shift again more towards trusting Commander without tearing down all infrastructure.

It's there from the introduction of the flight tasks. Any task that requires a local position fails to execute if its requirements are not fulfilled: afd02ac  
I'd rather not make a hole for just FlightTaskAuto but change how it works in general. Otherwise the same problem repeats if you switch to a different mode before arming.
