Describe the bug    
Currently, AutoLineSmoothVel is not aware if a waypoint should be stopped at, or if it should be continued 'through'. Thus, if Navigator does not update the waypoint to the next waypoint when AutoLineSmoothVel could have maintained speed through the waypoint, AutoLineSmoothVel will overshoot the waypoint since it will arrive at a speed to go through, rather than stop.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Make a mission with several waypoints in a straight line, spaced apart.  
2.Have a 'hold' specified at one of the middle waypoints for several seconds.  
Expected behavior    
The vehicle should smoothly stop at the middle waypoint specified. Instead, it will overshoot this waypoint by arriving too fast, then have to backtrack back to the waypoint.
