I couldn't always reproduce the accel problem, but the gyro calibration did not work at all.  
That's because gyro instance 2 only seemed to publish once and then stopped which matches the warning that you see about accel 2.  
@dagar's fixes in \\\#19660 seem to fix that. Once I cherry picked these two commits onto the release/1.13 branch, the calibration for gyro and accel looked much better for me.  
Before:  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [commander] [cal] calibration started: 2 gyro        
INFO  [commander] [cal] progress <0>

...        
[stuck forever]        
```  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [commander] [cal] calibration started: 2 accel        
...        
INFO  [commander] [cal] Hold still, measuring up side

```  
After:  
    
```bash
