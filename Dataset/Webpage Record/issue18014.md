@dk7xe  would you please test \\\#18017  
It fixes a bad stop but there is still massive leaking.  
Also, please list what HW is connected and command you have issued

@dk7xe  
hmmm.  
do you have code on your branch?  
I can not check out that hash:  
    
```bash     
 ` git checkout 607be59fd5b47160326052dea8eea7edc7619d66        
fatal: reference is not a tree: 607be59fd5b47160326052dea8eea7edc7619d66`        
```

Hi David, things connected:    
BMS772, UCANS32K with GPS via CAN0.    
Telemetry via TELEM2, GPS via GPS Port.    
ETH connected to T1ETH8 switch.  
Target build was fmuk66-v3_socketcan.    
UAVCANv1 and uORB via CAN is active.  
I did a fresh git clone last friday. No own code changes.

Hi @davids5    
since \\\#18017 was merged to master i tested a fresh master built.    
Now the hardfault came when i armed the rover during that try.

Afterwards the hardfault came at the moment of home position set.

Hi @dk7xe I am going to need some preproduces help on the HF.  
    
```bash     
 HW arch: NXP_FMUK66_V3        
FW git-hash: e9a21ee9110d3d25b1d330c3967c79d409da51a3        
FW version: 1.13.0 40 (17629248)        
FW git-branch: master        
```  
Is not PX4 master. Can you check your remote  
This is PX4  
    
```bash     
 FW git-hash: 11480cdbc7cee0ee0c05098555a912d1dfa5d357

```  
Maybe we can work thought it on a call. I am going to need the params set and commands that are causing the fault.
