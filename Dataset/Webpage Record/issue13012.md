I get the following error when attempting to make px4_sitl gazebo_hippocampus  
I believe this is related to me not being able to use the commander takeoff function as it returns    
ERROR [commander] rejecting takeoff, no position lock yet. Please retry..

I can reproduce this. There seems to be no GPS lat/lon/alt.  
    
```bash     
 pxh> gpssim status

@LukasAKeen I suggest you do a git bisect to figure out when it broke. That's assuming there is some version in the past where it still works.

Hi @julianoes : I'm also facing this issue while trying to simulate Hippocampus UUV: barometer and magnetometer's simulated readings go stale on PX4's boot.  
Noticed the following:  
- In debug mode their measurements do come through for few seconds before going stale i.e. with same timestamps.  
- Tried changing the simulation lockstep by setting PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR to 10 from the default value of 1 in debug mode without any breakpoints, and the issue persists.  
- Control commands from the discussion on AUV simulation: Enable start without ROS wrappersÂ \\\\\#7888 work with stale barometer and magnetometer measurements.  
Please find below my console log from running make px4_sitl_default gazebo_hippocampus.  
Would like to know how this can be fixed so that a more complete controls-simulation test could be achieved.  
Appreciate your help very much.

Have you tried without lockstep?

Thanks for replying. Baro/Magnetometer error exists after disabling lockstep in Gazebo and SITL board.

Only initially and it still let's you execute everything, right?
