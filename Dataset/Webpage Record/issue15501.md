Describe the bug    
PX4 Version: v1.11.0-rc1    
Simulation modell: tiltrotor    
After the front transition, when entering into the FW config, the motors which are not used (turned off with the param VT_FW_MOT_OFFID) are set to a PWM value of 900 with this code. Why do they go back up to a value of 1000 right after? Is there a specific reason for this? It does not behave like this with the standard_vtol model, which turns off all hover motors in fw mode.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.start simulation with the tiltrotor model  
2.Uploaded mission with a Vtol Takeoff Mission item  
3.Start mission  
4.Observe the motor PWM outputs  
Expected behavior    
The turned off motors stay at a PWM value of 900 during the whole fw mode.

I'm not able to reproduce on current master and SITL - in my case the MC motors go to 900 PWM after transition.
