Describe the bug  
The crazyflie 2.0 platform, using the latest Firmware, does not communicate with QGC through USB nor through the PA radio.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Install latest master or 1.9.0beta Firmware in Crazyflie 2.0 hardware  
2.Connect to QGC using USB or the PA radio (with cfbridge)  
3."Waiting for connection" is displayed on QGC indefinitely  
Expected behavior    
QGC should display vehicle status and parameters  
Log Files  
Using cflib 1.6.0 and cfbridge from https://github.com/dennisss/cfbridge  
Output of cfbridge with latest firmware (or 1.9.0beta) [nothing shows up on QGC]

Is PX4 on the Crazyflie 2 actively used by anyone? Let's decide if we actually want to keep it supported and I'll get one on the test rack.

I'm torn. On one hand we never had good flight performance (mostly due to its sensory design, using an IMU via I2C), on the other hand it would be an interesting platform.

Hi guys,  
Will the Crazyflie 2.1 be supported with PX4?

@dagar Our lab at UC Berkeley (https://hiperlab.berkeley.edu/) is actively using PX4 on crazyflie 2.0. We would really appreciate it if you can keep it supported.

@spheroidal that's cool. And could anyone help us to support and maintain PX4 on crazyflie 2.0? And for instance help with this issue here?

@julianoes I've been trying to debug this issue. I found that 3859bbb\\\#diff-2dc55367f11ba4d01e3ba810ed3fe35d is the last commit that works on the crazyflie 2.0. After the pull request https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/pull/11256/commits, which updates the Nuttx, the codes still compile normally but didn't work after it was flashed to the crazyflie 2.0. Would you mind taking a look at what could be the problem in that pull request? I am not familiar with Nuttx and get stuck in debugging this... Thanks a lot!

I don't have the time or hardware, I'm afraid.  
Do you have a serial console where you would see startup output to get an idea where it fails?

Sorry, I don't have a serial console now. I could try that when I have time.
