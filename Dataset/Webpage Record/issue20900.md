Describe the bug  
The variable alt_reset_counter in  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/ekf2/EKF2.cppLine 975  
      inaf33671*/vehicle_global_position_s global_pos;  
```  
is not initialized.  
My assumption is it should probably be initialized but I'm not 100% sure if 0 is enough or whether it needs to be tracked as a private member variable.  
I'm hoping that @bresch or @RomanBapst can help, thanks!

Thanks @julianoes, fixed in \\\#20906.  
I'd really like to keep valgrind and address sanitizer running clean, but so far it's been too slow to run on github actions. Honestly it might be worth having a dedicated test machine that can handle running testing under Valgrind.
