Describe the bug    
There seems to be a corner case where if the vehicle is unable to get close enough to the takeoff waypoint (due to high winds), the vehicle will never use TECS pitch setpoints resulting in a crash.  
- TECS pitch setpoints are not used in takeoff flight mode  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cppLines 873 to 882  
      inf492fa9*/use_tecs_pitch &= !(pos_sp_curr. type == position_setpoint_s::SETPOINT_TYPE_TAKEOFF && (_launch_detection_state == LAUNCHDETECTION_RES_NONE || _runway_takeoff. runwayTakeoffEnabled ())); // flaring during landing use_tecs_pitch &= !(pos_sp_curr. type == position_setpoint_s::SETPOINT_TYPE_LAND && _land_noreturn_vertical); if (use_tecs_pitch) { _att_sp. pitch_body = get_tecs_pitch (); } }  
```  
- If the vehicle is not close enough to the takeoff waypoint, it will continue to stay in takeoff mode therefore not use the pitch setpoint from TECS  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cppLines 184 to 190  
      inf492fa9*/} else if (_mission_item. nav_cmd == NAV_CMD_TAKEOFF) { /* for takeoff mission items use the parameter for the takeoff acceptance radius */ if (dist >= 0 . 0f && dist <= _navigator-> get_acceptance_radius () && dist_z <= _navigator-> get_altitude_acceptance_radius ()) { _waypoint_position_reached = true ; }  
```  
However, the throttle is set from TECS:   
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/fw_pos_control_l1/FixedwingPositionControl.cppLine 864  
      inf492fa9*/_att_sp. thrust_body [ 0 ] = get_tecs_thrust ();  
```  
- This results in the airspeed getting invalidated and results in a crash  
    
```bash     
  WARN  [airspeed_selector] Airspeed sensor failure detected. Return to launch (RTL) is advised.        
```  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Run SITL Plane in a windy environment (set wind speed to 14m/s)  
    
```bash     
 make px4_sitl gazebo_plane__windy        
```  
2.Uploaded mission with a takeoff waypoint up wind  
Log Files and Screenshots    
Test condition: windspeed 14m/s, takeoff waypoint is up wind
