Describe the bug    
We were able to flash master on the latest QGC 3.5.6 on the Durandal flight controller. The problem is that we are getting a Mission transfer fail error message when loading the Mission on QGC. We tried with USB and Mission failed, USB and battery connected and Mission failed, it seems to work via Telemetry. We formatted the SD card and we encountered the same issue.

Notes  
QGC popped up this messages after every few tests.  
Every time this error was shown, we turned off the vehicle, and tried again but the issue persisted, so we turned off the vehicle took the SD card out and placed it back in, after this "troubleshooting" step, we were able to by pass this error every time it popped up.

We flashed the master branch on the latest QGC 3.5.6 on the Durandal flight controller. Same issue getting, Mission transfer fail error message when loading the Mission on QGC, via USB cable. We tried with USB and battery connected and Mission was uploaded successfully. However, we are encountering another error, Baro Sensor \\#0, see images below:

@Tony3dr do you have a powered USB hub?  
Can you test again, with a powered hub and no battery?
