I'm ran into the case where I get continuous "Data link lost" messages in SITL, using the Dronecode SDK and QGC.  
    
```bash     
 WARN  [commander] Data link lost        
WARN  [commander] Data link lost        
WARN  [commander] Data link lost        
WARN  [commander] Data link lost

```  
    
```bash     
 [10:39:25|Debug] MAVLink: critical: Data link lost (system_impl.cpp:292)        
[10:39:25|Debug] MAVLink: info: Data link regained (system_impl.cpp:292)        
[10:39:26|Debug] MAVLink: critical: Data link lost (system_impl.cpp:292)        
[10:39:26|Debug] MAVLink: info: Data link regained (system_impl.cpp:292)        
[10:39:27|Debug] MAVLink: critical: Data link lost (system_impl.cpp:292)        
[10:39:27|Debug] MAVLink: info: Data link regained (system_impl.cpp:292)        
[10:39:28|Debug] MAVLink: critical: Data link lost (system_impl.cpp:292)        
[10:39:28|Debug] MAVLink: info: Data link regained (system_impl.cpp:292)        
```  
The way to reproduce this is:  
1.Start PX4 SITL  
2.Open QGC and let it connect.  
3.Close QGC  
4.Start SDK

I believe this has to do with the type of connection the SDK uses. I've heard this before. Look into how GCS timeouts are being used and what the SDK exactly is sending.

As far as I know the SDK is sending pretty much the same as QGC ust with another component ID.  
The problem was that both mavlink instances keep sending the time when the last heartbeat arrived which caused the toggling behaviour in commander.
