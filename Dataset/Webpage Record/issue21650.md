Describe the bug  
Unable to calibrate ESC with UAVCAN power module.    
For cuav's v6x flight controller, it only provide a uavcan power module. follow the official esc calibration instructions will lead a failure esc calibration.  
To Reproduce  
Follow official  esc calibration document  
Expected behavior  
ESC calibration complete  
Log Files and Screenshots  
Always provide a link to the flight log file:  
- Download the flight log file from the vehicle (tutorial).  
- Upload the log to the PX4 Flight Review  
- Share the link to the log (Copy and paste the URL of the log)  
Add screenshots to help explain your problem.  
Drone (please complete the following information):  
- Flight controller: CUAV V6x  
- PX4: v1.13  
- QGC: V4.2.6.  
Additional context  
Not sure this issue should be submited on PX4 or QGC

Hi Tianming Li, A possible solution for ESC calibration issue on cuav's v6x flight controller is to perform the calibration manually using UAVCAN GUI Tool or via the Mavlink console, as the official ESC calibration instructions may not work. It's also recommended to ensure that the ESCs are properly connected and powered, and that the firmware on both the flight controller and ESCs are up to date. Additionally, if the issue persists, it's best to seek help from the PX4 community for further assistance. It's important to provide a detailed description of the problem and any relevant information, such as flight logs and screenshots, to help others understand the issue and provide a better solution. It's worth noting that some ESCs may require specific calibration methods or settings depending on their brand or model. As such, it's recommended to consult the ESC manual or manufacturer's website for more detailed guidance. Additionally, if the ESCs are damaged or malfunctioning, calibration may not resolve the issue and they may need to be replaced. Ultimately, proper calibration of the ESCs is crucial for safe and stable drone operation. Finally, it's important to ensure that all safety precautions are taken when working with drones and related equipment. This includes wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, such as safety glasses and gloves, and following all relevant safety regulations and guidelines. By taking the necessary precautions and following appropriate guidance, it's possible to resolve the ESC calibration issue and achieve optimal drone performance. Thanks & Regards Siddhartha Sharma

I'm not sure the LLM answer above is helpful.  
@TianmingLi are you sure you actually need to calibrate your ESCs? I would not expect that UAVCAN ESCs need calibration. They might need setting up the min/max params and some bench testing to check it's working as expected but they don't need the sort of PWM max/min calibration that basic PWM ESCs require.

Sorry for my unclear information.  
Power module is UAVCAN protocol.  
But ESC module is PWM protocol.

â€¦    
By now, I used actuator testing pannel to calibrate ESCs.  
1.Disconnect battery  
2.Slid all motor to the top  
3.Connect  battery  
4.Wait beep beep  
5.Slid all motor to the bottom

Hi Li,    
We are also facing same error with you.    
After manually calibrating, how do you know that it is calibrated?

Remove propeller, Arm the vehicle, Open Mavlink console  
type  
    
```bash     
 pwm info        
```
Check Motor spinning status with PWM output value.

Thank you for the information above.    
Do you know what to do if all the info for 4motors are different even if the drone is horizontal?
