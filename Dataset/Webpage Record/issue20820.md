Setup  
Ubunutu 20.04    
Ros2 Foxy  
First I tried following the Documentation PX4 User Guide  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.launch simulator  
    
```bash     
 cd ~/PX4-Autopilot        
make px4_sitl gazebo        
```  
Everything look  fine until here, as I receive the INFO [commander] Ready for takeoff    
2. launch micrortps_agent  
    
```bash     
 source ~/px4_ros_com_ros2/install/setup.bash        
micrortps_agent -t UDP        
```  
I get this error:  
    
```bash     
 micrortps_agent: command not found        
```  
So I installed the  mircoROS aplication, following the provided instruction.  
After step 1., I run the following commands:  
    
```bash     
 source ~/microros_ws/install/local_setup.bash        
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent udp4 --port 8888 -v        
```  
Again everything looks fine, as the terminal with the simulator running shows that the topics have been successfully created.  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [microdds_client] synchronized with time offset 1671720811191683us

INFO  [microdds_client] successfully created rt/fmu/out/vehicle_status data writer, topic id: 224        
```  
Now after having removed the ExecuteProcess from sensor_combined_listener.launch.py, as below:  
    
```bash     
 def generate_launch_description():        
    sensor_combined_listener_node = Node(        
        package='px4_ros_com',        
        executable='sensor_combined_listener',        
        shell=True        
    )        
    return LaunchDescription([        
        sensor_combined_listener_node        
    ])        
```  
3.run launch file:  
    
```bash     
 ros2 launch px4_ros_com sensor_combined_listener.launch.py        
[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /home/aut/.ros/log/2022-12-22-15-58-24-512841-aut-hp-441179        
[INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO        
[INFO] [sensor_combined_listener-1]: process started with pid [441181]        
```  
But then nothing gets printed.  
However, if I manually subscribe to the topic, I get data:  
    
```bash     
 ros2 topic echo /fmu/out/sensor_combined

The QoS of the subscriber does not match the one of the publisher. You can see that from ros2 topic info /fmu/out/sensor_combined -v:

Thanks for the answer, but I can make the two qos to match? I'm trying to modify the sensor_combined_listener.cpp without success.

They don't have to match, you just need to make them compatible.    
Try changing https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com/blob/af846cbeecdb147d4062f7c928ea3fc19ae60263/src/examples/listeners/sensor_combined_listener.cpp\\\#L53-L54 to  
    
```bash     
 subscription_ = this->create_subscription<px4_msgs::msg::SensorCombined>("/fmu/out/sensor_combined",      
rclcpp::QoS(rclcpp::KeepLast(1)).best_effort().durability_volatile(),      
[this](const px4_msgs::msg::SensorCombined::UniquePtr msg) {    
```

Solved, thanks. Also, the launch file was missing the output='screen' parameter.
