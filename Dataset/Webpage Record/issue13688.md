Describe the bug    
A drone suddenly drops down 0.5-1 meters when switching to OFFBOARD on the flight.  
The problem is that for some reason when I switch to OFFBOARD for the very small first period of time the POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED.vz is positive (so the drone goes down). It is also observable in /mavros/setpoint_raw/target_local. The very first message after switching to offboard:

I do not know how to fix it.  
When I set to OFFBOARD on the ground - everything works just fine, I am able to take off, fly around and land.  
PX4 Firmware: 1.8.2.    
Cube flight controller  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Initialize EKF2 on the ground (vision is available). Publish vision pose and orient to /mavros/vision_pose/pose_cov.  
2.Move the drone nearby on the ground, where vision is not available.  
3.Takeoff in manual mode with RC.  
4.Fly to the area where vision is available (1.5-2 meters height).  
5.If vision is available -> grab position and orient from /mavros/local_position/pose and publish several setpoints to /mavros/setpoint_position/local  
6.Switch to offboard.  
7.The drone suddenly goes down 0.5-0.7 m but then stops, goes back up and follows the setpoints.  
Expected behavior    
I expect the drone to hover at the position where and when the OFFBOARD is enabled.

@negvet ok it's likely that this has been fixed in 1.9 or 1.10. I would suggest to try with the newer releases.
