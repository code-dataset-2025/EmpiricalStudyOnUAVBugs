Describe the bug    
When I run PX4 v1.13.0-beta on Pixhawk 4 in HITL with jmavsim, it fails to arm because of Preflight Fail (compass, accel, gyro and baro). I tried with 3  different Pixhawk 4 but the issue is always the same  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Follow the steps to have PX4 in HITL mode  
2.It fails with:  
    
```bash     
 $ ./Tools/jmavsim_run.sh -q -s -d /dev/ttyACM0 -b 921600 -r 250        
Buildfile: /home/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/jMAVSim/build.xml        
make_dirs:

copy_res:        
BUILD SUCCESSFUL

```  
Expected behavior    
Sensors should not be failing as we are do a simulation through jMAVSim

I can see this issue in Gazebo as well, even without the Sensor 0 missing error:

It looks like this is related to \\\#19419.  
The problem is that the PR assumed lockdown means termination which is not the case for HITL where the outputs are "locked down" but nothing is in failsafe/termination.  
I suggest to fix that for now as suggested in \\\#19681.

Now the next problem I run into is that it refuses to take off:

So far I found two separate issues:  
1.    
The flight time is estimated as too short. Presumably this happens because the battery percentage jumps from 100% to 70%, that's my current guess    
2.    
The outputs are not correctly routed through to the simulator. I'm a bit confused what happened to the actuator output topics. The pwm_out_sim module seems to publish the actuator_outputs_sim topic, however, mavlink sends the normal actuator_output topic:    
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/drivers/pwm_out_sim/PWMSim.hppLine 93  
      inc5bbf45*/uORB::Publication<actuator_outputs_s> _actuator_outputs_sim_pub{ ORB_ID (actuator_outputs_sim)};  
```  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mavlink/streams/HIL_ACTUATOR_CONTROLS.hppLine 69  
      inc5bbf45*/uORB::Subscription _act_sub{ ORB_ID (actuator_outputs)};  
```  
I assume this has somewhat changed with the introduction of control allocation? Do you have any hints @bkueng or @dagar what's missing?

@julianoes I have seen the same issues  
    
      
```bash       
 1. The flight time is estimated as too short. Presumably this happens because the battery percentage jumps from 100% to 70%, that's my current guess          
```    
--> the HITL sensor message generate a remaining time = 0. I have fixed that in local and I will make the pr.  
    
      
```bash       
 2. The outputs are not correctly routed through to the simulator. I'm a bit confused what happened to the actuator output topics. The `pwm_out_sim` module seems to publish the `actuator_outputs_sim` topic, however, mavlink sends the normal `actuator_output` topic:          
```    
--> I had the same issue in SIH too (see here) and setting UAVCAN_ENABLE to 0 fix the issue for both SIH and HITL. But I think this is not a good fix. Maybe you have a better proposition?

This won't be necessary anymore with dynamic control allocation.
