Describe the bug    
No rate sp are being published in the first second of a front transition.  
log file (todays master in sitl):    
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=7e8f18ac-0800-4c4b-a947-7773ed1ddc41  
To Reproduce    
Do a VTOL front transition in sitl, all control modes (stabilized, alt, pos) seem to be affected.  
Additional context    
Noticed it only because of accidentally triggered front transition, while also giving some roll input before. Then the rate_sp froze for 1s at a large value, almost resulting in a flip of the VTOL.    
@dagar @RomanBapst  FYI
