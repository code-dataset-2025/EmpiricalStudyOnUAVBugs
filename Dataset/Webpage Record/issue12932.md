Describe the bug    
Boot hangs at mixer loading on a Pixhawk Cube (FMUv3).  I can't get to the nsh prompt and the console seems to hang at mixer loading  
To Reproduce  
1.Current Master branch (47e668e)  
2.Set SYS_AUTOCONFIG 13012  
3.Reboot  
Expected behavior    
I expect to reach a nsh console during boot
