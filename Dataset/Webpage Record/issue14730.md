When running ll40ls start -X -b 4 a Garmin LidarLite on that bus won't start. When running ll40ls start -X, it does start.  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Flash PixHawk 4 with v1.11.0-beta1 firmware  
2.Connect a Garmin LidarLite on the I2C A port.  
3.Use QGC's mavlink console, and run ll40ls start -X -b 4.  
4.Nothing happens.  
I expect the driver to start and to begin producing distance_sensor data.  
I ran this on a PixHawk 4 on my desk, connected to my PC with USB. One/two LidarLites and nothing else connected to the PixHawk.  
More details, testing starting both, only one at a time, with lidars on both buses, and on only one bus at a time:  
      
        
          
Lidar connected on I2C A and B          
Lidar connected on I2C B (bus 2)          
Lidar connected on I2C A (bus 4)          
        
          
ll40ls start -X          
Starts on bus 2 and 4          
Starts on bus 2          
Starts on bus 4          
          
ll40ls start -X -b 2          
Starts on bus 2          
Starts on bus 2          
Nothing starts (expected)          
          
ll40ls start -X -b 4          
Nothing starts (unexpected)          
Nothing starts (expected)

Use ll40ls start -X -b 1. With external buses, the bus numbering should match the label, so you don't have to know about board internals.

Oh! I didn't realize. Should've tried that. Do you know is this is documented somewhere?  
Edit: Just to be sure: Does that mean they are they are numbered in the same order as the naming of the I2C ports on the hardware, so port A is -b 1 and port B is -b 2 and so on?

And for completeness' sake: I tried -b 1 now and it works perfectly.

ll40ls -h?

It should, but not sure if it's correct for all boards. Let me know if you find inconsistencies.

You're right, it does indeed say  
After having previously tested  
    
```bash     
 ll40ls start -X        
```  
and getting  
I was certain that the -b option would expect the same numbering as printed here (I'm clearly mistaken).  
I think this might be confusing for other people as well. Maybe the ll40ls help output can be modified, or this made clearer in some other way.  
As far as I can tell this is new behaviour in v1.11, with v1.10 using the same numbers internally and for the -b switch.

It was a mixed bag prior to v1.11. Some drivers implemented this mechanism, some implemented it differently, some only worked on 1 "special" bus. As of v1.11 it should all be handled consistently now (+/- minor bugs per board).

What if we extend the output to say on I2C bus 4 (1. external bus)?

What do you suggest?

I see, that sounds much better. I have mostly used the ll40ls driver, so I didn't realize other drivers acted differently in v1.10.

We have  
- internal as in used with -I, and  
- external as "4" in ll40ls \\\#0 on I2C bus 4 (external), and  
- external as "1" in -X -b 1  
Do we have terminology to differentiate the last two?  
One possible solution is to print an explanation if the user tries to ll40ls start -X -b <num> with an invalid bus number. Something like  
    
```bash     
 No ll40ls sensor found on bus <num>. Buses specified with `-b` are numbered based on FCU port names, such that port I2C A is bus 1, and so on.        
```  
Or a less verbose variant. I'm not sure if all FCUs name their ports "I2C A" etc. so that might need adjusting.  
A drawback is that if the numbering using with -b is say, 1, 2, and the numbering in on I2C bus x is 2, 1, you'll never get the warning, but the sensors will be swapped.

Yes that is generally too verbose and would clutter the boot output unnecessarily.

Yeah, I guess so.  
Then I suggest a slight modification to your suggestion: on I2C bus 4 (corresponds to -b 1). I just think explicitly mentioning that this number is used with -b is useful.
