Describe the bug    
Changing the initial rotation (yaw) of the copter iris_vision in Gazebo SITL causes the vision position estimation to fail. With different initial yaw like the default in iris_vision.world it works, albeit very shaky.  
To Reproduce    
Modify iris_vision.world by rotating the model:  
    
```bash     
 [...]        
<include>        
      <uri>model://iris_vision</uri>        
      <!-- Original: <pose>1.01 0.98 0.83 0 0 1.14</pose> -->        
      <pose>1.01 0.98 0.83 0 0 -1.5</pose>        
</include>        
[...]        
```  
Run make px4_sitl gazebo_iris_vision, switch to position mode and take off, hover a few meters above ground. After a few seconds the copter flys away full speed, and then the failsafe kicks in and switches it to Altitude mode.    
Console output:  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [ecl/EKF] EKF aligned, (pressure height, IMU buf: 14, OBS buf: 9)        
INFO  [ecl/EKF] 1432000: EKF commencing external vision position fusion        
INFO  [ecl/EKF] 1432000: EKF commencing external vision yaw fusion        
INFO  [commander] Takeoff detected        
WARN  [commander] Failsafe enabled: no local position        
```  
Expected behavior    
Not sure, honestly :) Even with the default initial yaw of the model the copter is very unstable so maybe the noise/drift parameters of the Gazebo vision plugin are just too extreme? I don't know. However, I would at least expect the behavior to be independent of the initial yaw of the copter, that is, it should either always work or always fail (after some time maybe).

@michael-p what version of the Firmware are you using?

I tried this with the current master, but was also able to reproduce it with an older version (at commit 190c817).    
Sadly the latest stable release 1.9.2 does not compile so I cannot try that.

Why? You likely just need to remove -Werror.  
FYI @kamilritz

Yes I believe this was fixed in \\\#12108, that's why I did not open an issue for it.  
I just confirmed that in v1.9.2 the problem exists as well, although the console output is slightly different: (the ERROR line is different)  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [commander] Takeoff detected        
ERROR [commander] Critical navigation failure! Check sensor calibration        
WARN  [commander] Failsafe enabled: no local position        
```

I think I just ran into this as well. Pending further testing. @tzai can you try to reproduce using the iris_vision model in vanilla SITL (no ROS)?

I think this should solve the issue: PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic\\\#399
