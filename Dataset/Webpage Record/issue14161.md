Describe the bug    
if during the Hardware tests there is a hardfault, the test pass and doesn't fail.  
To Reproduce    
for example, this  and this tests has been failed but the test passed.  
from the tests done on \\\#14097, all the nxp tests fails since  commit 156cf16 there is hardfault.  
Expected behavior    
Fail on hardware fault, for sure.    
the hardware test is great tool, but if it really check the CPU load, driver proper initializations, RAM and of course hardfault.    
I think that in addition to the tests there should be some addons such scrapping the shell output, looking for ERROR/FAIL from any module that might send such message.    
maybe analyze the top, for any issue, and so on.  
Ideas?    
I opened this thread to enable sharing ideas, or maybe on-going-work that is already done on this issue
