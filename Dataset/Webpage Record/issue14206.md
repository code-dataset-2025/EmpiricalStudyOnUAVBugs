Describe the bug  
The CAN port on the Pixhawk4 Mini is not working.  
When checking the CAN High and CAN Low signals, there is no data being transmitted.  
Tested on v1.10.1 Stable and current master.  
To Reproduce  
1.Set UAVCAN_ENABLE to 1, 2 or 3.  
2.Reboot  
3.UAVCAN devices never get node ID.  
Expected behavior    
Turn on UAVCAN through UAVCAN_ENABLE, reboot, connect UAVCAN device, and it will get a node ID. If no device is connected and you scope CAN High and Low, you will see data being transmitted.  
Log Files and Screenshots  
Pixhawk4 Mini with UAVCAN enabled. CAN High and CAN Low.  
Expected behavior: Pixhawk4 Standard with UAVCAN enabled. CAN High and CAN Low.  
TXD - Transmit Data input it idling high. Doesn't look like STM32 is sending any data.

I pulled open the Pixhawk4 Mini and checked that the pinout is correct.  
With UAVCAN_ENABLE set, on boot when I run uavcan status, it is not running. When I run uavcan start, it appears to start. But when I run uavcan status after that, I get a hardfault.  
    
```bash     
 nsh> uavcan status

```  
When I run uavcan start, the TX and RX lines actually start toggling.    
And the CAN High and CAN Low look as expected.    
When I connect my UAVCAN smart battery, I see the data on TX and RX, but it never gets a node ID. Then when I run uavcan status it hardfaults. The same behavior whether something is connected or not.

I have verified with Holybro that their schematic is correctly connected to CAN1.  
On the STM32.    
CAN1_SILENT_S0 -> PH2    
CAN1_TX -> PH13    
CAN1_RX -> PI9.  
On the CAN Transceiver.    
CAN1_SILENT_S0 -> S Pin 8    
CAN1_TX -> TXD Pin 1    
CAN1_RX -> RXD Pin 4

uavcan start  - start uavcan    
uavcan start fw - starts the fw update and node ID server (Only on CAN1)

@AlexKlimaj The other thing to check is if the silent pin is in the right state.

Silent pin is low.  
Running uavcan start fw, then uavcan status produces the same result. Device never gets an ID and uavcan status produces a hard fault.

Do you know if this is pixhawk 4 mini specific? Have you tried the pixhawk 4 or another fmu-v5?  
Is it possible you're hitting a legitimate hardfault in the uavcan battery code?

I've tested on my branch, 1.9.2, and 1.10.1. All exhibit the same behavior on the Pixhawk 4 Mini.  
Up until now, I have been doing all my testing on a Pixhawk 4 with no issues.

I also just discovered that uavcan on the Pixhawk 4 doesn't work without an SD card inserted.

Okay, now this is getting weird. I was just able to replicate the behavior on the Pixhawk 4.  
Deleting the uavcan folder on the sd card and resetting the uavcan parameters seemed to resolve it.

Hi @AlexKlimaj  
    
Can you add a note in the UAVCAN documentation that it requires an SD card?    
Can you confirm that you're saying UAVCAN itself requires an SD card be present to work:  
- on all versions of PX4?  
- on all Pixhawk hardware (or just Pixhawk 4/mini)?  
- and that this effects any UAVCAN peripheral? -e.g. escs/power modules etc?  
- UAVCAN0 or 1 or both?  
Sounds like an unfortunate dependency - SD card dies and plane falls out of sky?  
How to fix depends a bit on above, but probably good to add notes to:  
- https://dev.px4.io/master/en/uavcan/  
- https://dev.px4.io/master/en/uavcan/notes.html  
- https://docs.px4.io/master/en/peripherals/uavcan_escs.html  
- https://docs.px4.io/master/en/power_module/  
Seem reasonable?

@hamishwillee Unless something has changed, it is only needed while the UAVCAN FW server and node ID allocation is done at boot up. The FW server is stopped after that and the memory is reclaimed.

@davids5 Thank you. Is there any way for an end user to know or infer that this is a possible reason their (UAVCAN) motors won't start and power module doesn't supply info etc? i.e. this creates a dependency that every PX4 device must have an SD card (at boot) if it may have UAVCAN. That doesn't feel reasonable - but perhaps this is already a requirement somewhere?  
Based on your comment, do you think it reasonable I add the following note in various places:  
    
Note UAVCAN requires that an SD Card is present on boot (only).

I would go with, Note UAVCAN requires that an SD.

@davids5 Why omit the "on boot" clarification? I find it comforting to know that if my SD card dies in flight my UAVCAN motors won't :-)

@hamishwillee  because you will have to define the moment it is ok to not have it.  When will that be?  
Use the HW to see how it works with current FW.  Testing it on a unit will tell you how it really works, not how we think it works! Please take the initiative to do this sort of thing when questions arise.  
Card out of the system.

ERROR [uavcan] Firmware Server Failed to Start -1        
```  
Reinsert card into the system (This will not work)  
    
```bash     
 nsh>  uavcan start fw        
ERROR [uavcan] FirmwareVersionChecker init: -1, errno: 19

ERROR [uavcan] Firmware Server Failed to Start -1        
nsh>        
```  
reboot - You have to boot with the SD in the system - and then finish FW upgrades and Node ID Allocation. BEFORE you remove the card.

```  
Just tell the story as it is:  
"The SD card is required for UAVCAN Node allocation and firmware upgrade. It is not used during flight by UAVCAN"

@davids5 - Thanks very much. I'll take your advice re the text.  
    
Please take the initiative to do this sort of thing when questions arise.    
I am unlikely to do this type of testing. While it is trivial for you, I don't have the knowledge, hardware, or understanding of how to interpret the results. Sorry if that is frustrating - but usually getting expert answers is a better use of everyone's time.

@AlexKlimaj - My FMUv5 mini RC09 would not start UAVCAN  
I get  
    
```bash     
  CAN driver init failed -1006        
```  
On investigating it, the board is built with \\# interfaces = 2, this is incorrect for the HW. But it is a shared bin file for the V5 and the Mini. So that is a problem that needs to be fixed. If I force the driver to return, with only on interface, I get no data on the one interface. I also get a hard fault on the accessing of that interface with uavcan status. That should not happen in the real world as the driver should not start. So the question is why did you board start?  
Rebuilding the code with https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/boards/px4/fmu-v5/default.cmake\\\#L12 set to 1, works on a FMUv5, but there is not traffic on the mini. ....  
Looking at the data on the scope, I can see the the polarity of the CAN H and L are swapped on the mini.  
FMU V5 Correct    
CANL Chan 1 (yellow)    
CANH Chan 2 (green)  
FMUV5 Mini - is Incorrect!    
Looking at the schematics I see there is an error on the Breakout board crossing CANH to CANL.

On the Mini hardware I have (which was purchased in December 2019), it is not swapped on the breakout board. I opened it up and verified the pinout from the pin of the CAN transceiver to the GH pin.  
I only get the hardfault if I start uavcan manually, then it hardfaults if I do uavcan status. Otherwise, uavcan is not started on the Mini even with the parameter set to turn it on.

@AlexKlimaj - We must have different HW.  
Are you using mavlink console?    
do a dmesg and you will see that the boot failed to start uavcan, then the second time (you do it manually) it will start, but that is wrong, It should not.  
Try rebuilding with  https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/boards/px4/fmu-v5/default.cmake\\\#L12 set to 1, then run it.

I am using the debug port.  
dmesg shows the failed boot.    
ERROR [uavcan] CAN driver init failed -1006  
Changing UAVCAN_INTERFACES 2 to 1 solved the problem! No hardfault either.

@AlexKlimaj - It was confirmed by the manufacture that the mini's prior to January 23,2019, has the swapped lines.  This was mostly proto runs and should not have effected later production. But worth knowing.  
Would you please check today's master, compiled with UAVCAN_INTERFACES 2. I would expect it to still need to started manually, but not hardfault.  
I will work on the correct fix.

@davids5 Looks like the hardfault is fixed.    
On boot:  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [uavcan] Node ID 1, bitrate 1000000        
ERROR [uavcan] CAN driver init failed -1006        
```  
If I start it manually with uavcan start fw the driver starts but does not function. uavcan status no longer hardfaults in this scenario.  
If I set UAVCAN_INTERFACES to 1, the driver starts on boot and is functional.

I have a found the same as davids5 (post on Feb 29). The CAN bus high and low connections are physically swapped in the PH4-mini hardware I have. I have a PixHawk4 and a mini, and the 4 has always just worked, but the mini never. Finally got the scope out to look at the signals and they are definitely swapped. This hardware was only bought mid to late last year. I know this is not the main topic of this thread, but it is the only place I have found this pin swap mentioned. Be warned, not all problems are software.

Thanks for the update. The firmware bug is fixed, so if UAVCAN is still not working on a Pixhawk 4 Mini, you likely have older hardware with the pins swapped.
