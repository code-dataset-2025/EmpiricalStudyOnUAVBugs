Describe the bug    
In SITL rover in master mission mode works in qgroundcontrol with takeoff waypoint. but in the a real vehicle in mission mode,    
rover stands still. it arms and works in stabilized mode, but does nothing on the mission mode.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Upload any mission to a rover that is working in stabilized mode.  
2.switch to mission mode (either from the transmitter or from the qgc )  
3.it goes to mission mode (shows in qgc)  
4.actuators doesn't respond.  
Expected behavior    
Rover should navigate the mission just like in the SITL  
Log Files and Screenshots

@yuthikasagarage What is considered as "just a generic rover frame" ?

@Jaeyoung-Lim  i can see that    
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/rover_pos_control/RoverPositionControl.cppLine 239  
      in1d88081*/_act_controls. control [actuator_controls_s::INDEX_THROTTLE] = mission_throttle;  
```  
and  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/rover_pos_control/RoverPositionControl.cppLine 522  
      in1d88081*/_actuator_controls_pub. publish (_act_controls);  
```  
What might be blocking the actuator outputs in a real vehicle?

@yuthikasagarage Given that this works in SITL, it is not a algorithmic problem, but some of the assumptions in the code might not be valid.  
We need to first check why zero actuator controls are getting published

@yuthikasagarage We need to check why it is not moving, and probably we will not know by just looking at the code, we need to debug it

@Jaeyoung-Lim  apparently 1.10.1, (e0f016c)    
has worked with the mission mode on a real vehicle, also in 1.10
