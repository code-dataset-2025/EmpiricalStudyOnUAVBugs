Describe the bug  
make px4_sitl gazebo is working for most possible worlds and models that I try.  However, for make px4_sitl gazebo_boat it hangs at  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [dataman] data manager file './dataman' size is 7866640 bytes        
PX4 SIM HOST: localhost        
INFO  [simulator_mavlink] Waiting for simulator to accept connection on TCP port 4560        
```  
I'm running in WSL on windows 10  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior - in WSL command prompt:  
1.> git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive  
2.> ./PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh  
3.> HEADLESS=1 make px4_sitl gazebo_boat  
4.See error  
Expected behavior  
Expected PX4 SITL start up to continue.  
Additional context  
I've tried verbose logging of gzserver but no clues.  I've tried all other gazebo worlds and models and they all work, including uuv_hippocampus.

Bug does not exist in v1.13.0.  If I checkout that branch and follow the same steps, the boat simulation works.
