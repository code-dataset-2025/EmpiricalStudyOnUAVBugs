Describe the bug    
The vehicle loses RC connection and yaws to home heading. (We have loiter as our RC loss behavior: NAV_RCL_ACT = 1)    
To Reproduce    
Current master just cause an RC loss.  
Expected behavior    
Keep the current heading.

Additional context    
We are hitting a failsafe which we should not be hitting. FlightTasks::update() is failing at line 607 in mc_pos_control_main.cpp. This triggers failsafe(). Note the vehicle does not actually descend....

The random yawing only happens when we hit the failsafe()

it happens because the mc_pos_control_main knows that there is no RC at the same time as commander does, but it takes some time until the commander tells mc_pos_control to switch to auto-loiter.    
I will add an additional task that does not require RC. This should fix it

Keep the current heading.    
If MPC_YAW_MODE is set to home, then once there is an RC loss the vehicle will enter loiter with heading towards home.

I am not setting MPC_YAW_MODE. The default is towards waypoint. What does "towards waypoint" mean for the case of RC loss (loiter)?  
I just flew this PR and I am no longer seeing the failsafe but I am still seeing the yawing (not every time). Notice the first disconnected (postion to loiter) the yaw does not change, but on the second disconnect it does.

Ok. i will update you tomorrow once I found the reason for that random yawing.

I think I found the issue. At least i think it is the same issue that you encountered.  
To reproduce the issue (possible in SITL).  
- Fly in Auto Hold  
- Do a GoTo command such that the vehicle needs to rotate towards the new target  
- Before the vehicle reaches the desired heading (the vehicle wants to point towards the GoTo location) switch into Position. Without any stick inputs, the vehicle should just hover.  
- unplug the joystick. The vehicle will stay at the current location, but will rotate towards the old GoTo location.  
The cause can be best be explained with the prints below:    
From the top to the bottom:  
- vehicle is in Hold mode -> this is just Auto  
- target and position in xy happens to be [-6.137, 33.6149] and position is [-2.832,-22.560]. In order to point towards the target, the vehicle needs to rotate (just believe me that this is the case). distance is just the distance between target and position.  
- at --------reset triplets I switched from Hold to Position. It that happens, the navigator sets the triplets to invalid, which should be some sort of reset (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/navigator/navigator_main.cpp\\\#L725-L736).  
- I then unplugged the joystick to cause RC-link loss. In yellow color the commander correctly detects RC-loss. So far everything is as expected.  
- due to the RC-loss, the vehicle will correctly enter Auto. However, FlightTaskAuto receives for a few iteration a target of 0 and then the old target followed by another reset of the triplets (not sure why) instead of a target that corresponds to the current location. However, this second reset has not changed anything and the target is again the old target. Finally, there is another reset and this time the target will be the current location (not shown)  
The time it takes from RC-loss to the correct target location is quite short and therefore it is not visible by eye that the target is wrong.. The yaw, however, is handled slightly different:    
https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/1a1a04c0948752dc643c9a466507fe902e18cd4f/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/Auto/FlightTaskAuto.cpp\\\#L258-L265    
and compute heading method:    
https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/1a1a04c0948752dc643c9a466507fe902e18cd4f/src/lib/FlightTasks/tasks/Auto/FlightTaskAuto.cpp\\\#L485-L499  
v is the distance in xy between the target and the current position of the vehicle. If this is larger than zero and not smaller than NAC_ACC_RAD ( = 2.5 in your setup), then the vehicle will set the yaw_setpoint such that the vehicle points towards the target. In the example above, this means that during that short time period when it receives the old target, the yaw_setpoint is set to the heading towards the old target. Once the correct target is received (= current position), the v.length() is close to 0 and for sure smaller than NAV_ACC_RAD. From the code snippet above, this means that yaw_setpoint will no longer be adjusted and remains whatever it was. Consequently, In our case the yaw_setpoint remains pointing towards the old target.  
In order to fix the actual issue, one needs to dig into the navigator. For the time being, I added now a yaw-lock, that becomes active once the vehicle is within NAV_ACC_RAD. During the lock, the heading is set to the current yaw.

Thanks! I just flight tested this on a pixracer (6 flights total of ~23 mins flight time) and everything looks good!
