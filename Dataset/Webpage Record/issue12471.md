Describe the bug    
When the takeoff altitude is set too low (< than around 0.7 meters) using the param MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT a quadcopter won't takeoff but just auto-disarm again.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Start SITL jMAVSim or Gazebo  
2.param set MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT 0.5  
3.commander takeoff  
Expected behavior    
It should still take off even if the altitude is quite low.

Additional context

@julianoes We changed quite a bit the waypoint tracking logic since then, could you check is this issue is still there?

@bresch nice! I tested 0.5m and 0.3m which worked. 0.2m worked sometimes and 0.1m stayed on the ground but that's already much better!  
The MAVSDK test used is:  
    
```bash     
 build/src/integration_tests/integration_tests_runner --gtest_filter="SitlTest.ActionHoverSyncLower"        
```  
plus this diff:  
    
```bash     
 diff --git a/src/integration_tests/action_hover_sync.cpp b/src/integration_tests/action_hover_sync.cpp

@julianoes BTW, why is the Navigator not complaining?    
MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT is the lowest altitude you should be able to go during takeoff:    
https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/b9fab04adbfd92783206a08364c8fea077f1ed39/src/modules/navigator/takeoff.cpp\\\#L86-L105    
Are you setting that parameter differently or are you not passing through this logic?

I'm using this parameter to set the takeoff altitude before a takeoff.
