Describe the bug    
If the position measurement of one GPS module changes fast the output of the blending algorithm gives a faulty output  
To Reproduce    
Here is a replay logfile with two GPS modules connected. At t=80s a position offset is added to gps0 (blue). The red line is the internal GPS blended state and the green line is the output of the blending algorithm that we push into ECL    
Expected behavior    
The offset between the output signal and the internal blended gps state should be monotonically decreasing.  
Additional context    
The issue seems to originate from the fact that we account for the blending weights twice, once in the calculation of the offset between the _gps_output[0-1] and the _gps_blended_state, and once in the offset between the _gps_output[2] and the _gps_blended_state
