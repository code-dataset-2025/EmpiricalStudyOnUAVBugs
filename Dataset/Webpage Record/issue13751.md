Describe the bug    
Sadly I found another corner case of race condition with the thrust setpoint state when switching from Stabilized to a position controlled mode. I found that sometimes in SITL jMAVsim the drone instead of taking of when giving it the command just detects takeoff, landing and disarms.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.SITL jMAVsim on master  
2.Make sure it starts and stays in Manual mode  
3.Wait for GPS lock  
4.Send takeoff command from QGC  
5.See problem in ~ 1 out of 5 cases  
Expected behavior    
The vehicle should still take off even if the takeoff command, mode transition and arming are basically instantaneous like in a SITL setup.

Additional context    
The problem is very similar to \\\#12171
