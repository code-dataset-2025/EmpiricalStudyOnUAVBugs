This might need to be brought back in: \\\#20342  
What does your terminal say, should have a debug about motor topic subscriptions.

I am on Ubuntu 20.04, and my ignition gazebo version is  
    
```bash     
 $ ign gazebo --versions        
6.12.0        
```

@Jaeyoung-Lim Did you build fortress from source and/or is your system fully updated with latest binary release? Here is what it should look like: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10233412/188332692-97fa5b59-b61b-4ad4-991d-6e669b4dadd9.png  
From: gazebosim/gz-sim\\\#1689  
Looks like you are getting the old: [Err] [MulticopterMotorModel.cc:253] Please specify a robotNamespace.  
Which is why it's not flying.

@Jaeyoung-Lim current version with updates should be 6.13.0:    
Wondering why the old script to check for that got removed, as that would have eliminated this issue to begin with, @dagar should we re-add it? \\\#20342

Reinstalling the package ignition-fortress didn't help, but wondering if it is in one of the dependency trees that are not getting reinstalled properly.

Probably we now need mission tests running in CI to prevent this from silently breaking

Thanks @bperseghetti  for the support!  
Updating manually to libignition-6-dev to point at 6.13.0 solved the problem

I have the same issue on the current main with Gazebo Garden and Ubuntu 20.04. Any suggestion?

@MichaelBosello Could you open a new issue and describe your problem exactly?    
The issue here is resolved, so likely you have a different issue with similar behavior

@Jaeyoung-Lim  I get the same error in this issue    
[Err] [MulticopterMotorModel.cc:255] Please specify a robotNamespace.    
And the vehicle doesn't move. I make it work by manually defining the robotNamespace of the motors plugin in the model.sdf:    
<robotNamespace>x500_0</robotNamespace>    
But it isn't a good way to handle the problem  
I'll open a new issue
