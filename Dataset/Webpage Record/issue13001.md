Describe the bug    
I get the following error in SITL:    
ERROR [mavlink] system boot did not complete in 20 seconds  
Whole output for a MAVSDK hover test is:

@dagar I assume this has been introduced recently?

Yes - \\\#12968  
We should check the timing here to make sure it's actually working as intended (20 seconds from system start), but other than that I think 20 seconds is arbitrary. It's really only a fallback if the system doesn't hit mavlink boot_complete for whatever reason.

I wonder why this happens for SITL now.
