Describe the bug    
The flight controller will not allow mavlink connections on hardware after setting the parameter SYS_MC_EST_GROUP to LPE and rebooting the flight controller.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Flash pixracer with v1.12.0-beta2 with default params  
2.Set the airframe to Generic Quadrotor X  
3.Set the SYS_MC_EST_GROUP parameter to LPE  
4.Reboot flight controller  
5.Attempt to create mavlink connection to board using qgroundcontrol  
6.See error where re-connection does not occur  
Expected behavior    
It was expected that the flight controller would boot like normal after setting the parameter and rebooting.  
Additional context    
I first noticed this issue on a Modal AI Flight Deck board and then tested on the pixracer to confirm the board was not the issue.  
Additionally, I tested this bug in the gazebo simulation and the simulation was able to start and the drone was able to takeoff like normal.

I'll see if this can be resolved in time for v1.12, however I'd still strongly recommend switching to EKF2 as LPE isn't really supported anymore.
