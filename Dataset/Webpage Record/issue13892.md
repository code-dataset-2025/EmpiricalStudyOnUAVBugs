Describe the bug    
The vehicle did not connect to RC, it would not let the user bind the RC nor calibrate, the same issue was noticed on Master it seems to be working on Stable firmware. This is a brand new flight controller shipped from Drotek, the previous flight controller had bad vibrations and the mag data looked bad. We suspect the issue was something electrical and the flight controller was replaced. Now we are having a failed connection to the RC.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:    
Binding Procedure:  
RC Steps:    
1- Turn on RC    
2- Activate Biding mode (RC will make beeping sounds)  
Vehicle Steps:    
"With the vehicle turned on"    
1- Unplug the receptor    
2- Press Binding button and keep pressed    
3- Plug in receptor (without letting the binding button go) and make sure both red and green light of the receptor are turned on.    
RC Step    
1- Disable binding mode    
Vehicle Step:    
1- Confirm binding by having the receptor with a solid green light on (algo confirm by moving flight modes switches.)

@dagar the Pixhawk 3 Pro seems to be working on Stable firmware but not Master. We installed the damaged flight controller on the F450 vehicle and encountered the same issue. Both new and damaged flight controller, vehicle not connecting to RC, it would not let the user bind the RC nor calibrate.
