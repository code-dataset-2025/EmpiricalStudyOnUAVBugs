Describe the bug    
When using GPS blending we calculate a position offset to apply to each measurement in order to smooth out the data we push into the EKF in case of fast varying GPS accuracy metrics. However, if one GPS module lose fix we don't decrease this value but keep applying the last calculated offset indefinetly.  
To Reproduce    
Collect a replay logfile with two GPS modules connected. During replay, force one GPS module to lose fix.  
Expected behavior    
The GPS data we push into the EKF should converge to the GPS module still working if the other lose fix.  
Log Files and Screenshots    
A horizontal position offset is added to one GPS module to more easy illustrate the issue. At t=100s the main GPS lose fix.
