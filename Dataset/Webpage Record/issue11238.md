Describe the bug    
Intermittently, the aircraft, when powered on and sitting on the ground with no RC transmitter turned on, will print out that it lost RC control, arm itself, spin up the motors, then switch into LAND failsafe because  GPS hasn't locked yet. The problem seems somewhat intermittent, but we can go for stretches of hours where it will do it on every boot.  
Logs of the event show that it receives input_rc messages every 3-20 seconds, with  SOURCE=RC_INPUT_SOURCE_MAVLINK and 8 channels of 65535 values. When looking at the scaled manual control inputs in the log viewer, that gives an almost full yaw command and zero throttle, which may be the source of the arming.  
We also have ensured that the RC_IN lines while not connected to an RC transmitter are not floating electrically.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Unplug RC receiver, and remove props!  
2.Power on aircraft  
3.Wait  
4.Sometimes it will arm and takeoff.  
(Note that in our case we have the CBRK_IO_SAFETY set so that is NOT necessary to press the safety switch before launch), otherwise the arm would be prevented.  
Expected behavior    
We expect the aircraft to sit there and never arm  
Log Files and Screenshots    
Because the system arms, it starts logging. here are some logs from the events. It is worth noting that the input_rc message in the logs show a few received values, even though there are no  RC receivers connected, and the source is listed as MAVLINK.

Drone (please complete the following information):    
Our  system is based on a custom adapter board with a Pixhawk 2.1 cube on it, a wifi module, and a long range radio. The adapter board has an MCU that can communicate with the cube. In order to rule out all external sources of mavlink traffic, we wiped the adapter MCU and disabled the wifi serial port and unplugged long range RF, and can still get it to happen. Our PX4 code fork is based on 1.7.3 release with a custom CAN driver for our ESCs.

Are you using QGroundControl? If so can you verify if thumbsticks are enabled (check settings and the fly screen).

We do use QGroundControl, but we can get this to happen with all external data links disconnected. We'll check and make sure of that however.  
We can see the lost manual control message on the serial terminal

Unsure if this is related, but I have a pixhawk 4 (px4 1.8.1) connected via USB to QGroundControl 3.4.4 on  a completely separate computer, and nothing else plugged in at all to the pixhawk. I'll periodically get the manual control lost error pop up, and if I use MAVLINK inspector, I see a single MANUAL_CONTROL  packet get sent, then it starts sending RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE at 10hz.  
The only cable plugged in to the pixhawk 4 is USB. This could be unrelated, but the lost control messages when there wasn't any to begin with is the same.

Side question - why are we sending RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE? https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/95eff332632f59ad3584a25169ce92691f7b0222/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_messages.cpp\\\#L3410-L3424  
@julianoes @bkueng any idea?

Can you share a corresponding log (.ulg)? You can set it to log from boot (SDLOG_MODE 1).

Yeah, here you go. I'd turned on log from boot to try and capture. In this case, the input_rc message source is UNKNOWN, but there is no RC anything plugged into this box. The last part of log 1 is when the pixhawk fell off the table because of the USB cable...

This sending of RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE bit; I don't understand why this is necessary, but when I looked at the code it seemed like it sends them out to the same MAV_SYS_ID as the current system.  
If I have two aircraft that are powered up and their radio modems are on the same channel, and they both have the save MAV_SYS_ID, the send of RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE from one system could be interpreted as rc_inputs on the other?  
Understanding that two aircraft with same sys_id on the same channel is bad, I'm wondering if that is the loop in our system that is causing our issue.

We also sometimes get spurious "Manual Control Lost" warnings through QGC.  Our vehicles never have RC receivers plugged in.  
here is a recent example log of this on our vehicle (running a lightly modified version of v1.8.0 firmware):    
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=1fb297c5-c8f9-46dd-a24b-232451e7d5e1  
the vehicle in the log above was very repeatably throwing the Manual Control Lost warnings shortly after establishing telemetry connection (40-50 seconds after boot in this case).  Since connection had just been made, the is a bunch of telemetry and SDcard activity as mission and parameters are automatically downloaded to QGC from the vehicle.   We removed the SD card and re-inserted it and then magically no more "manual control lost" warnings.

@Antiheavy The problem is the CPU load - the manual control lost check fails because commander is not running for an extended amount of time. This might be related to hardware you have onboard or specific modifications. But it has absolutely nothing to do with the RC itself.  
Please have a look at the CPU load plot.

I believe I've solved our problem. Our aircraft had the same MAV_SYS_ID set, and were inadvertently able to communicate because the channel settings on our serial radios matched. Commands sent to one aircraft by either RC input or a brief noise glitch was getting copied into the RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE message and transmitted, and being received by the other aircraft and being interpreted as valid RC data.  
The overall cause was that our aircraft had same system id and radio, however the unsafe aspect came in because of the retransmission of the rc signals on the RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE message.  
In our case I've solved the problem by disabling the send of RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE, and also preventing reception of it. This removes the vulnerability of this happening in the future.  
I'd like to understand why the RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE message is being sent in the first place, and propose that a more rigourous check be done before accepting such commands.

@Antiheavy The problem is the CPU load    
Yeah, that was part of the point I was trying to make, but I didn't explain it very well.  We always see CPU load spikes correlated with the Manual Control Lost warning messages.  I wanted to post my example in case it was helpful in debugging @jzazbert 's issue.  I also am hopeful if there is a systematic bug uncovered it might also alleviate our example too.  Although the CPU spikes in @jzazbert 's logs are not as closely correlated to the manual control warnings as they are in our logs so the might be a different root cause.

In our case, I think the bulk of our "manual control lost" messages are because the RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE messages being sent out from one aircraft to the other are relatively low rate due to available bandwidth on the channel, so it keeps exceeding the RC timeout threshold, getting a new packet, then exceeding the threshold again.  
That said, I can still get this to happen on a idling pixhawk 4 so... who knows what causes some of those. The logs in that case showed periodic SBUS PX4IO packets every so often, which I attribute to noise since I had to RC RX plugged in in that case.

In our case, I disabled reception (and transmission) of the RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE message for safety.  
This wasn't my preferred solution as it likely breaks other things in the future, but until there is a more robust mechanism for control authentication, it solved my safety problem.

@LorenzMeier can you explain why we are sending RC_CHANNELS_OVERRIDE?

Most likely this was a legacy use case (e.g. using a Pixhawk as RC adapter). I would disable it.
