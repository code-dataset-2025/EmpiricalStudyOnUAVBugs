Describe the bug    
With an optical flow sensor, the local position is valid and it is possible to to an automatic takeoff before global position is valid. As soon as the GPS checks pass and the global position is valid, the drone starts to move to in some direction (previous origin?). This is truly commanded and is most likely an issue in FlightTaskAuto.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Do an auto takeoff with flow only (without ever having global frame initialized)  
2.Start GPS in air  
3.When the global position gets valid, the drone will start to fly towards some direction  
Expected behavior    
Stay at the same location, shift properly the origin of the local frame and the memorized positions.
