Describe the bug    
On master, I am unable to calibrate the mag on CUAV Nora. Either during the calibration, or after it is done but before the values are saved, the autopilot reboots itself and I lose the calibration.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.CUAV Nora on master  
2.Calibrate mag with QGC  
3.See error  
Expected behavior    
The magnetometer should be calibrated correctly.  
Log Files and Screenshots    
No flight log since I wasn't flying ðŸ˜„ Unfortunately I am not sure how to get more debug information. I tried taking a look at the debug UART shell output but didn't get anything useful. I can try using a debugger or bisecting to find the commit culprit.  
Add screenshots to help explain your problem.  
Drone (please complete the following information):  
- Just a CUAV Nora connected over USB to QGC. Have observed the same thing over telemetry radio as well.  
Additional context    
Please let me know what I can do to help you reproduce this.

When you say master, which specific commit was that? There was a recent fix for mag cal on master.

From dev call: Could you please run the calibration on this branch \\\#17439 with logging from boot running at the same time and share the log such that we see if the stack is running out for some reason in that use case.

Seems to be working after \\\#17439, closing for now. Will open up again if the issue shows up during further testing.
