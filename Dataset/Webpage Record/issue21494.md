Describe the bug  
On our hexacopter we had a crazy takeoff because the switch on the RC for the Flight mode was in Hold mode when power on the drone, but PX4 did not switch automatically to Hold position once we got the GPS position and remained in Manual mode (which is not assigned in our case...). We did not see this and when we took off, the drone climb up like crazy before we take back the control by switching to Position mode !..  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Assigned one switch of your RC to Hold mode  
2.Power on your drone with the switch of Flight Mode on Hold mode  
3.Wait for the drone to start, it will stay in Manual instead to go to Hold mode even when good position is set  
Expected behavior  
PX4 should automatically switch to Hold mode once a GPS position is set  
Drone (please complete the following information):  
- Pixhawk 4 with PX4 v1.13.2  
- Hexacopter

@afwilkin thank you for considering my case ! Please find the flight log here  
Flight mode are assigned on channel 5 and are as follow:  
    
```bash     
 COM_FLTMODE1, 8 --> Stabilized        
COM_FLTMODE2, -1        
COM_FLTMODE3, -1        
COM_FLTMODE4, 4 --> Hold        
COM_FLTMODE5, -1        
COM_FLTMODE6, 2 --> Position        
```  
Switch was on hold mode, but manual has been set by PX4:

Hot fixed by changing the manual mode to hold mode with my companion computer...
