Describe the bug  
EKF module is not starting in replay mode and the replay returns "Startup script returned with return value: 65280    
" after following the steps described in https://docs.px4.io/v1.12/en/debug/system_wide_replay.html  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Checkout to main branch (at the time of writing -- 97f632a408 )  
2.Build for sitl target to generate a sample ulog file by make px4_sitl_default jmavsim  
3.Follow the instructions from the EKF2 Replay in this tutorial  
4.After target is built in replay mode, parameters cannot be exported, ekf2 module doesn't start. Replay stops and returns the value 65280 as in the screenshot below.  
5.Problem exists also if the ulog file is generated by the FMU.  
Expected behavior  
Replay should be completed and another ulog file with the replayed data should be generated.
