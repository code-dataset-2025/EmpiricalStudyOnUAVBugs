Describe the bug  
If the throttle is inverted on the RC, after calibration is done with QGC, values of the throttle are from 0 to 1 and the vehicle rejects arming.  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Setup the RC in a way that the throttle is inverted  
2.Calibrate radio with QGC  
3.Check the minimal throttle value, for example in the uorb topic manual_control_setpoint.  
4.Check the value of RCx_TRIM for the throttle channel, it will be set to RCx_MAX.  
Expected behavior  
The throttle value should be from -1 to 1. The vehicle should arm when the throttle is set to a minimum.
