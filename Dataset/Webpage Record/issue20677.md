Describe the bug  
Since 1.12 geofence_breach_check doesn't take into the account value of GF_SOURCE parameter. It always uses global_pos.*  So during no_global_pos drone can breach geofence significantly.  
Here is the code from 1.12. from new geofence_breach_check function. It uses only global_pos as the source of drone location.  
`_gf_breach_avoidance.setHorizontalTestPointDistance(test_point_distance);    
_gf_breach_avoidance.setVerticalTestPointDistance(vertical_test_point_distance);    
_gf_breach_avoidance.setTestPointBearing(test_point_bearing);    
_gf_breach_avoidance.setCurrentPosition(_global_pos.lat, _global_pos.lon, _global_pos.alt);    
_gf_breach_avoidance.setMaxHorDistHome(_geofence.getMaxHorDistanceHome());    
_gf_breach_avoidance.setMaxVerDistHome(_geofence.getMaxVerDistanceHome());  
    
```bash     
 	if (home_position_valid()) {        
		_gf_breach_avoidance.setHomePosition(_home_pos.lat, _home_pos.lon, _home_pos.alt);        
	}        
	fence_violation_test_point = _gf_breach_avoidance.getFenceViolationTestPoint();        
	gf_violation_type.flags.dist_to_home_exceeded = !_geofence.isCloserThanMaxDistToHome(fence_violation_test_point(0),        
			fence_violation_test_point(1),        
			_global_pos.alt);        
	gf_violation_type.flags.max_altitude_exceeded = !_geofence.isBelowMaxAltitude(_global_pos.alt +        
			vertical_test_point_distance);        
	gf_violation_type.flags.fence_violation = !_geofence.isInsidePolygonOrCircle(fence_violation_test_point(0),        
			fence_violation_test_point(1),        
			_global_pos.alt);`        
```  
Old logic in geofence.Check() is now used only in DO_REPOSITION and ORBIT commands handlers.  
To Reproduce  
Drone needs to be in no_global_pos state.  
Expected behavior  
if GF_SOURCE == 1 _gf_breach_avoidance should rely on gps_pos topic, not on global_pos topic.  
Drone (please complete the following information):  
Multicopter
