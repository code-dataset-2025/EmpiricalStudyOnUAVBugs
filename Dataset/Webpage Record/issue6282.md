I've debug why ekf2 refuses flow measurements (using gazebo sitl) and found that we have:  
in LPE: src/modules/local_position_estimator/sensors/flow.cpp  
    
```bash     
  float dt_flow = _sub_flow.get().integration_timespan / 1.0e6f;        
        if (dt_flow > 0.5f || dt_flow < 1.0e-6f) {        
                return -1;        
        }        
```  
in EKF2: src/lib/ecl/EKF/estimator_interface.cpp  
    
```bash     
       float delta_time = 1e-6f * (float)flow->dt;        
      bool delta_time_good = (delta_time >= 0.05f);        
```  
I think the check condition should be inverted in case of EKF2

@svpcom That's correct. I already asked @priseborough about that. The real PX4Flow sends flow messages at ~20fps, but the simulations runs at 100Hz. Not sure why the ekf limits the rate

The EKF limits the rate for a number of reasons:  
1.The data buffers used to time align data can only reliably handle data at rates of 20Hz or lower. We can increase the buffer size to handle higher rates, but  that causes problems with some processors that are low on RAM.  
2.Optical flow fusion is a more expensive operation than GPS fusion and reducing the fusion rate helps lower power processors.  
3.Due to the integration between samples, reducing the rate to 20Hz does not hurt performance for the yaw rates typical of optical flow operation.

With the modified px4flow firmware in my PR I stabilize the flow output rate using a param to 10 hz. It is helpful for this.  
@ChristophTobler if you get a chance, take a look at the PR. I'd like to get this merged. I've had many users confirm as well as via my own testing that it is more robust indoors and outdoors.

@priseborough Ok, that makes sense. So I will adapt the way the optical flow messages get published. It will still use full fps but integrate over several frames and only publish at arount 10-20Hz.  
@jgoppert I will take a look at it. But I need to build a new PX4Flow quad setup first.

@priseborough But now if we submit flow measurements with rate > 20Hz (for example 20.001Hz) we don't got any errors or warnings but instead all measurements will be silently ignored. I think we need to add some error reporting and add some guard interval to prevent occasional message drop due to flow rate fluctuations.

@jgoppert Also with EKF2 + flow and without gps copter unable to takeoff (due to unfocused sensor). I think we need add the same workaround as LPE does.

It won't ignore all messages, just the ones arriving sooner than the minimum allowed interval.

In case of SITL (100Hz flow), all flow messages was silently ignored. Because flow->dt is optical_flow.integration_timespan which is a constant

@svpcom yes that's the default setting for the ekf2 flow simulation and commander takeoff works just fine for me (with the rate adaption in the ekf flow update)

The rate at which the ekf2 can accept observations, which sets the size of the buffers, is controlled by the EKF2_MIN_OBS_DT parameter. From memory it is defaulted to 20msec (50Hz) in master.

@svpcom Just to make sure: You have changed the lines you mentioned in your issue? But once you takeoff manually position control works?

@ChristophTobler Yes. I've removed check for 20Hz in EstimatorInterface::setOpticalFlowData and POSCTL became works after manual takeoff.

@priseborough EKF2_MIN_OBS_DT is used only for magnetometer and altimeter. In case of flow data it supplied to EKF2 anyway and rejected in  EstimatorInterface::setOpticalFlowData by hardcoded delta_time < 0.05 check  

## Comment17

@svpcom That is incorrect.  
The optical flow max acceptance rate is set by _min_obs_interval_us.  
_min_obs_interval_us is set by _obs_buffer_length.  
_obs_buffer_length is set by EKF2_MIN_OBS_DT and the maximum of the various observation time delay parameters.

@priseborough There are a second check which hardcode 20Hz (see code below)  
EstimatorInterface::setOpticalFlowData  
    
```bash     
       // limit data rate to prevent data being lost        
        if (time_usec - _time_last_optflow > _min_obs_interval_us) {        
                // check if enough integration time        
                float delta_time = 1e-6f * (float)flow->dt;        
                bool delta_time_good = (delta_time >= 0.05f);        
...        
           if (delta_time_good && flow_magnitude_good && flow_quality_good) {        
...        
              _flow_buffer.push(optflow_sample_new);        
...        
           }        
        }

@svpcom Yes there are two hard coded checks. You mentioned two files in the in the issue so en figured you had them both, my fault... So now that you changed these two checks, I guess commander takeoffworks?

@svpcom I checked the simulation again and if you change https://github.com/PX4/ecl/blob/master/EKF/control.cpp\\\#L249 as well commander takeoff will work (I had both of them changed from the beginning).  
@priseborough Maybe it would be good to use parameters instead of hard coded 0.05f in https://github.com/PX4/ecl/blob/master/EKF/estimator_interface.cpp\\\#L283 and https://github.com/PX4/ecl/blob/master/EKF/control.cpp\\\#L249?  
For the flow calculation in the simulation: I'm adding a parameter to set the ouput rate of the flow. I guess a range between 5Hz and 20Hz would be good?

As I suggested:  
- set flow ouput rate: update submodule and adaptions for itÂ PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic\\\\\#79 will lower the ouput rate of the flow so it will work with the ekf2 and hard coded limits  
- Still I don't think that these limits should be hard coded and if so, it should be clearly stated in the dev guide  
- We might have to come up with a solution for taking off in flow mode

@ChristophTobler @priseborough  With commit 967197a flow became works, but only to first flow focus lost (for example flight out of asphalt texture). When I came back to textured field I'm unable to switch to POSCTL mode.  Flow data is good:  
    
```bash     
 delta_time 0.053213 is good: 1, flow mag: 0.025434 is good: 1, flow qual: 153.000000 is good: 1        
delta_time 0.052794 is good: 1, flow mag: 0.025106 is good: 1, flow qual: 185.000000 is good: 1        
delta_time 0.060996 is good: 1, flow mag: 0.022210 is good: 1, flow qual: 159.000000 is good: 1        
delta_time 0.051348 is good: 1, flow mag: 0.025605 is good: 1, flow qual: 185.000000 is good: 1        
delta_time 0.074743 is good: 1, flow mag: 0.024073 is good: 1, flow qual: 170.000000 is good: 1        
delta_time 0.056513 is good: 1, flow mag: 0.023177 is good: 1, flow qual: 185.000000 is good: 1        
```  
so it seems that something is broken in EKF2.  
How to reproduce:  
1.make posix_sitl_ekf2 gazebo_iris_opt_flow  
2.Switch to ALTCTL  
3.ARM and takeoff to 3m using joystick.  
4.Switch to POSCTL.  
5.move outside asphalt texture. Mode will failback to ALTCTL.  
6.Move back to textured zone.  
7.Try to switch to POSCTL -> unable to switch.

brew untap osrf/simulation        
brew tap px4/simulation
