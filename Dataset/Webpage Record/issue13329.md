It's also not working with v1.9.2, and I could not find docs about what device to expect on I2C.

Have you tested this compass with CUAV V5+ï¼Ÿ

Does neo gps work for rgb? I can't find these two flight controllers in China, but I tested the pixhawk series flight control with no compatibility issues. For the fmu v4 firmware, I tested the pixhack nano (isn't v5 nano; it has been discontinued; it belongs to fmu v4) It can support ist8310 (neo gps compass); so I think the connection may be wrong.

I tried i2cdetect and nothing showed up. Also, the GPS doesn't seem to be working either.

@cuhome can you provide me the pinout of the CUAV V5 GPS/Compass? Is it not compatible with Pixracer?

http://doc.cuav.net/flight-controller/v5-autopilot/en/v5+.html\\\#connectionï¼›This is the complete v5 definition, you need to look at the GPS&safety interface; it should not be incompatible with pixracer.

@julianoes Your pinouts order is wrong. This picture is the correct guide. Please follow it to fix it.

@cuhome so I am supposed to use the colors like you suggest? I don't understand this because I don't have blue and grey but I have orange and yello. So what should I do?

Oh, NO, you are using m8n GPS instead of neo GPS, you can modify it according to the following picture;

Aha, why is this not like the reference standard but different? ðŸ˜² Are the future products properly compatible at least?

Ok, the GPS works again but the mag does not answer on I2C. Presumably it is destroyed because 5v was applied to SCL or SDA.

@Tony3dr @dannyfpv can you check that the wiring on your CUAV GPS is correct?

@julianoes Because it is used in the pixhack series, for some reason, the CUAV Pixhack series of flight control does not use the Pixhawk standard pin. What you need to know is that the CUAV M8N GPS will be discontinued. We recommend using neo GPS.
