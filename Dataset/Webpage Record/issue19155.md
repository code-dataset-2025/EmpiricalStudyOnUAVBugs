Describe the bug    
SD card operations only seem to partially work on the Matek H743 Slim board. The firmware seems to be able to write files to the card, but seems to have issues reading files. Operations in nsh like ls seem to work in the /fs/microsd/ directory, but cat always fails with read errors for files on the SD card. cat works as expected on other ROMFS files. There are also various errors relating to parameters upon startup.  
Building from master, commit: 33ce1b9    
Host OS: Ubuntu 20.04, x86_64  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:    
NOTE: Start with no SD card inserted  
1.Build the bootloader target for the Slim make matek_h743-slim_bootloader  
2.Put the chip in DFU mode and connect to host machine over USB  
3.Use STM32CubeProgrammer to completely erase all flash sectors of the chip  
4.Use STM32CubeProgrammer (or dfu-util) to flash the Matek h743 Slim Bootloader to 0x08000000  
5.Disconnect the USB cable  
6.Build the firmware target for the Slim make matek_h743-slim_default  
7.Connect the FMU directly to the host machine via USB and wait for it to come up (/dev/ttyACM0 in my case)  
8.Use Tools/px_uploader.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 build/matek_h743-slim_default/matek_h743-slim_default.px4 to flash the firmware  
9.Disconnect the USB cable from the FMU  
10.Format a fresh (4/16/32GB sandisk) SD card using mkdosfs /dev/sdb -s 32 -F 32 -I (the results are the same after manually writing a .format file to the SD card and allowing the firmware to do the format)  
11.Insert the SD card into the FMU  
12.Connect the USART1 interface on the FMU to the host machine via USB FTDI adapter  
13.Start a terminal emulator session on the system console interface (for me: picocom -b 57600 /dev/ttyUSB0)  
14.Reconnect the USB cable from the host to the FMU to power on  
15.System console starts sending messages - pasted below  
16.Once nsh is available, confirm that I can ls files in /fs/microsd and that there are files there  
17.Try to cat the param_import_fail.txt file, which fails with a read failed: I/O error  
18.Try to create a file using echo "hello" > /fs/microsd/test, which seems to succeed  
19.Confirm the file exists with ls /fs/microsd/  
20.Try to cat the contents of that file as well, which raises another read failure, but this time the reason is invalid argument  
21.Try to cat the contents of a ROMFS file (/etc/mixers/vectored6dof.main.mix as an example), which succeeds and prints the contents  
I tested a very similar process with the mRO Pixhawk1 board, and everything worked as expected (and there were no errors during the boot process).  
Expected behavior    
Operations like cat should work in nsh on SD card files. There should not be so many errors during boot up relating to reading from and writing to the SD card.

Some progress on this issue:  
My previous steps above indicated that formatting the SD card via ".format" was ultimately behaving the same as manually formatting the card. This turns out to be both false and somewhat true.  
- While walking through the process a second time while monitoring the system console, I tried this approach and noticed that the format step was actually failing, because mkfatfs was not enabled in the NSH lib config.  
- I then enabled that and rebuilt/flashed the firmware  
- From here, I created the ".format" file, and the board successfully reformatted the board.  
- After this, the same set of errors seemed to present themselves: cat on microsd files had read errors, etc.  
- I issued a reboot command and after this, cat commands suddenly started working again on SD card files.  
I don't know if this is actually related to having PX4 do the formatting or not, as I have not yet walked through this "reboot and try again" process with a manually flashed SD card.

Is this reproducible on multiple units?  
@vvladic did you notice any issues?

@dagar yes, I have reliably reproduced the results on multiple boards with multiple SD cards. As mentioned, the issue does not happen on the mRO Pixhawk1.  
I currently don't have any other H743-based FMUs laying around to test on. I was trying to see if there were any fairly stable FMUv6 boards out there that people are regularly using and having success with, such that I can order one and use it as a "control" in my development process. The supported hardware page in the docs only mentions boards up to FMUv5X (from Holybro). I know Holybro has the Durandal, which is described as in beta, but don't have any reference for how stable/behaved it is in practice. Any feedback on that would be appreciated, to help decouple these issues from the Matek board specifically.

Another (potential) issue/symptom, despite things otherwise seeming to be working at this stage.  
I tried to run sd_bench, but keep getting an I/O error (5) upon write:  
    
```bash     
 nsh> sd_bench -r 50        
INFO  [sd_bench] Using block size = 4096 bytes, sync=0        
INFO  [sd_bench]         
INFO  [sd_bench] Testing Sequential Write Speed...        
ERROR [sd_bench] Write error: 5        
```  
This may just be a misunderstanding of how to use sd_bench, though I thought I should mention it, in case it was relevant.  
sd_stress seems to function as expected:  
    
```bash     
 nsh> sd_stress        
iteration 0 took 1466055 us: OK        
iteration 1 took 1487907 us: OK        
iteration 2 took 1488032 us: OK        
iteration 3 took 1468720 us: OK        
iteration 4 took 1487426 us: OK        
```

Additional failure: I tried to adjust the block size for sd_bench, just as an experiment, and the following series of errors occurred:  
    
```bash     
 nsh> sd_bench -b 512

```  
On the first try with -b 512, I got the same write error, but then afterwards, the temporary benchmark file could not be created at all. Running ls on the microsd directory shows nothing, as if the card was unmounted.  
Mounting the SD card on my desktop to examine the files, I have:  
    
```bash

```  
The benchmark file does seem to exist, but is 0 bytes, and there are no logs/fault reports anywhere.

Given that the issue is fairly inconsistent and intermittent, I had the same notion as @dagar that it might be related to clock configuration, where we are pushing on the boundaries of some hardware/driver limitation.  
Doing some comparisons between PX4 and Ardupilot, I noticed a PR in Ardupilot that explicitly dropped the max frequency for the SDIO interface to 12.5MHz for "increased reliability":    
ArduPilot/ardupilot\\\#17316  
Cross-referencing that with the current settings in PX4, I found that the max is currently configured to 25MHz:    
https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/boards/matek/h743-slim/nuttx-config/include/board.h\\\#L292-L297  
I took a stab at increasing the divider by 1 to drop the clock frequency to 12MHz, and so far all of the symptoms have gone away. I haven't gone through the task of walking through the whole clock tree to confirm/validate the actual numbers, but this seems to have made a positive impact at the least.  
sd_bench is now working and I'm getting decent results, compared to the table of benchmarked SD card speeds in the developer guide:

Will keep testing to see if anything crops up, and will try and find some time to validate the clock tree at some point.

Hello and thanks for reporting this.    
I tried to follow your procedure above, but I was unable to reproduce any errors.    
I am using some generic low quality Kingston 8gb card formatted on Windows machine.  
I can try it again today after work using some different high performance SanDisk cards, and maybe play with frequencies.  
If using the reduced clock frequency tends to bring more stable results on more SD card types and logging with all options selected still works, please consider opening a pull request with your changes.

@vvladic I've put up a PR which includes my very basic fix for the issue (on my board). I mispoke earlier saying that I had set it to 12MHz to solve the problem, and in fact had lowered it to 20MHz by incrementing the divisor value to 6.

WOW... this is alarming, as we suffer from the same in INAV buildups for the H743 ...
