Describe the bug    
Whenever doing a fixedwing takeoff, a warning message "Start loiter with fixed bank angle" is wrongly being triggered  
@sfuhrer FYI  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Start SITL with a plane model    
make px4_sitl gazebo_plane  
2.Start mission with a takeoff waypoint

Additional context  
- This seems to be appearing after GPS failsafe fixed-wing: constant roll loiter while keeping altitude and airspeed, then descendÂ \\\\\#17547 has been merged

What failsafe is actually triggering?    
No failsafe actually triggers, it's just that _pos_sp_triplet.current.valid  in FW Position controller gets set to valid one iteration after _control_mode.flag_control_auto_enabled and _control_mode.flag_control_position_enabled are set to true, and caused the internal FW position mode to be set to FW_POSCTRL_MODE_AUTO_ALTITUDE for one brief moment after triggering the FW takeoff.    
We could also think about removing _pos_sp_triplet.current.valid check from the logic here, I don't know in what case this can be invalidated.

Originally I think it was more for the ability to explicitly publish something that invalidates existing position setpoints that consumers already have.
