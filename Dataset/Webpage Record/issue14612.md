Describe the bug    
The first IMU of my cube black have a bad rotation.  
To Reproduce  
- flash a cube black with master  
- (reset all acc off to 0 and scale to 1 and reboot)  
- see estimated orientation or sensors measures (my cube was leveled) :    
Expected behavior    
Acc 0 should measure about -9.81m/s/s not +9.81

Additional context    
@bkueng it was ok at 2f3174a and not after 532ccd1  
Another issue happened when I tried to calibrated the acceleros with this issue: scales of imu 1 and 2 were negative.    
Shouldn't be great to have test on this

I'm not seeing this on current master (4e0441a) or master just before we switched to the new Invensense IMU drivers (7b12a21).  
Is this a new cube?

@dagar I am not sure of what you mean by a "new cube"    
There's apparently a new version of the Cube black (Cube Black+ ?) that changed the sensors (mpu9250 is end of life), but I don't know the details.

I think this cube is about 1 year old
