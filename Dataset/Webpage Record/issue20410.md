Additional context  
from the log, I found FC didn't start mavlink at ttyACM0. However, I have found that if I connected with QGC firstly, then closed QGC, after these operations, FC can be connected with mavros.  I did some tests as follows, which proved my idea. Becuase of my poor experience, I have failed to fix this bug.

I added  " mavlink start -d  /dev/ttyACM0 " at the last line of  rcS, and create /etc/extras.txt in SD card with "mavlink start -d /dev/ttyACM0" , it worked well now.
