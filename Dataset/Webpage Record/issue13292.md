    sensors: split out analog battery handling to new standalone battery_status module

Short term we can shift the analog battery parameters so that they're still present in SITL (which has no analog batteries).  
I think we need to maintain a list of params QGC depends on.

Longer term we'll need to do something QGC side for vehicles that only have digital power modules or even v5x that's somewhere in between (cell configuration, but no ADC to configure).

This also makes me wonder about automated testing between QGC and actual PX4 rather than just a mock link.

@DonLakeFlyer / @dogmaphobic can we start thinking about how to update the QGC power configuration gui for future systems that don't have analog power modules to configure?
