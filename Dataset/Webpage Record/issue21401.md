Describe the bug  
I am using the latest main branch, the board is the OmnibusF4SD. The drone is arming correctly but the motors are not spinning. I noticed using the nsh console that the file /dev/pwm_output0 is not there (was there with v1.13). Also using the console the command dshot start does not make the module start and it stays "Not Running".    
I modified the build configuration adding EKF2 and removing the GPS driver.    
Also in QGC it still shows the "Motors" tab instead of the "Actuators" tab.  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Compile the firmware make omnibus_f4sd_default  
2.Flash the firmware onto the board with QGC  
3.Open the NSH and start dshot module with dshot start  
4.Check the status with dshot status  
Drone  
Quadrotor is using OmnibusF4SD and BLHeli_32 4 in 1 ESC
