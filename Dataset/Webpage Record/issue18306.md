Describe the bug    
Offboard trajectory_setpoint sent while in an auto mode conflict with flight_tasks sending trajectory_setpoint since they both publish to the same topic. It appears everything is working correctly when sending trajectory_setpoints at the 10hz recommended by the offboard tutorial and in an auto mode, however this is because flight_tasks publishes at 50hz and is fast enough to essentially "override" the setpoints sent by the 10hz offboard publisher. When publishing at 100hz to trajectory_setpoint from offboard, the auto mode is essentially ignored and the offboard setpoint overrides the internal flight_tasks module.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Launch simulator and set PX4 to HOLD mode  
2.Send only trajectory_setpoints using offboard at 10hz and nothing happens  
3.Send only trajectory_setpoints using offboard at 100hz and observe HOLD mode is overriden  
Expected behavior    
There needs a way for trajectory_setpoint to be distinguished if it's coming from offboard or flight_tasks. When in offboard mode, flight_tasks no longer send trajectory_setpoints, but if in any auto mode, a conflict is possible if offboard setpoints are sent faster than the flight_task

This type of potential conflict needs to be prevented more fundamentally.  
Are you using Mavlink or ROS2/FastRTPS?  
In the mavlink case this should already be prevented until the system is actually in OFFBOARD mode.  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_receiver.cppLines 1004 to 1008  
      in03bd5e0*/if (vehicle_status. nav_state == vehicle_status_s::NAVIGATION_STATE_OFFBOARD) { // only publish setpoint once in OFFBOARD setpoint. timestamp = hrt_absolute_time (); _trajectory_setpoint_pub. publish (setpoint); }  
```

I'm using ROS2/FastRTPS

The quickest fix is to respect the nav_state before publishing (like mavlink).  
The better fix would be to publish the offboard setpoint on a different topic (same msg) and the consumer (the position controller) can decide which to respect based on the system state.

I'm working on a fix, and got multicopter position controller working, but for the rover, why is there 2 updates for trajectory_setpoint_sub?  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/rover_pos_control/RoverPositionControl.cppLine 431  
      in360c378*/_trajectory_setpoint_sub. update (&_trajectory_setpoint);  
```  
and  
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/rover_pos_control/RoverPositionControl.cppLine 478  
      in360c378*/_trajectory_setpoint_sub. update (&_trajectory_setpoint);  
```

```    
I don't think it's intentional, it's probably a result of how things evolved to this point with OFFBOARD setpoints previously getting to the controllers through a different topic.

Closing since mavlink handles this issue and using ROS2 is experimental and assumes the offboard computer must stop sending setpoints if a pilot takes over.
