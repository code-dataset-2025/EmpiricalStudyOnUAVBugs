Hi Dan and David.  
Setup:  
- Control Zero with USB cable.  
- SDCard inserted  
Steps to reproduce the issue:  
- Loaded stable/mro_ctrl-zero-f7_default.px4 and board boots up fine.  
- Connect via QGC  
- Set frame type to generic quad and reboot - board locks up in the middle of playing the startup tone.  
Output from console:

Notes:    
The MCU on this board is actually the STM32F777IIK6  
Suggestions?

Have you tried current master (what will soon be v1.11)? I'd would be great if we can have the board in good shape for the release.

Master is better, no more lock up.

The compass is the AK09916 inside the ICM-20948

What else needs to be done here?

Is there support for the AK09916 compass inside the ICM-20948?

@pkocmoud - I see the the AK09916 referenced in code. @dagar what is missing?

@davids5 does it matter that the wrong MCU model number is printed during bootup?

It seems counter productive that we lump all Invensense/TDK devices as MPU6000, that chip is obsolete and can cause confusion to if the proper device is even detected.  
I cannot tell if the ICM-20602 is detected or the ICM-20948 or both?

External I2C devices are not detected. Do you think this just a board config issue?

@dagar @davids5 - is there anything I can do to help push this along? Almost daily users are asking to use this board with PX4.

An update - I2C is fixed, just waiting on the ICM20948 driver to be completed and tested.

New icm20948 driver support. \\\#14567  
The IMU side was working (9 kHz raw data output), but broken at the moment as I work on enabling the AK09916 properly.

@pkocmoud Looks like we have all the prerequisites managed (driver support there, etc). Could you test the current configuration so we have a baseline?
