Describe the bug    
Pulse rate 400Hz and 50Hz are present at 8 times the rate at all outputs.    
Main rate is measured with osci 3.2KHz    
default rate 400 Hz (instead of 50)    
(cause Omnibus F4 and X2.1-777 behaves the same, probably fmu outs of all boards)    
Attention, servos connected to FMU can be fried !!!    
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:    
as soon as any of my Fcs are flashed    
default rate is displayed as 0 Hz    
All servos on FMU immediately moved to the end stop, the ESCs give Error beep.    
Attention, servos connected to FMU can be fried !!!    
Expected behavior    
like master of march 31th that behaves o.k.    
400Hz pwm rate gives 400Hz pulses    
50Hz default rate gives 50Hz

- which airframe did you select (SYS_AUTOSTART)?  
- param show PWM*  
- pwm_out status

doesn´t matter it´s on all Fcs and Airframes there ist something with frequencies in the FMU.    
I tried vtols like Convergence on Pixracer or X21-777  or Tailsitters    
on Omnibus.    
If the IO is switched of, the FMU on X2.1-777 gives the same.

Thanks for the detail, fixing this is my top priority.

@dagar The same pulse pattern also occurs when the master of 31 March is switched from 400Hz to Oneshot for a short time and then back to 400Hz again.    
pwm rate -g 1 -r 400    
pwm rate -g 1 -r 0    
pwm rate -g 1 -r 400    
corresponds to the OneShot timer but with 400Hz PWM setting results in 3.2 - 3.35 Khz

In order to eliminate such errors in the future, one could throw FMU OneShot completely overboard, as FMU dshot works extremely well. (At the IO it still makes sense, since dshot is not there) OneShot should output a constant frequency up to approx. 4 KHz. With all previous implementations, the output at the FMU tries to follow imu_gyro_rm, but never manages to do so and outputs a very unstable signal between 400 and 700Hz, which many ESC are not happy with, thus offering no real advantages over 400Hz standard PWM. I don't think OneShot has ever worked meaningfully with PX4. \\\#9739

I'm not sure about the OneShot issues, but I think I understand what's happening with the secondary PWM rate configuration. Let me see about a short term fix.  
We're working towards being able to explicitly configure all outputs directly (including conveying rate groups constraints).

Are there enough timers to do so? Would be great to have OneShot or DShot and Servos at adjacent outputs.    
Further I would often need 70Hz or 250Hz Servos and 400Hz Esc simultaneously ...  
The problem with OneShot then and now is mainly when servos with 50Hz are needed on another output group at the same time.    
With Airframe Generic Quad ESC Out, DSHOT and OneShot with 1KHz works with the current error without any problems including successful flight tests. Only standard PWM e.g. 400Hz gives a signal pulse width at all frequencies is 1/8 = OneShot and 3.2KHz (400 Hz times 8) frequency which only controls the clockwise rotating motors successfully with a slight hum modulation in the motor noise I would not recommend flying with it right now.

\\\#17427 solves the PWM issue for me, any combination of default and alternative rates now offer the right output pulses after reboot.    
The incorrect 3.2Khz behaviour is only still present if you briefly switch to OneShot and then back to alternative rate.    
pwm rate -g 1 -r 400    
pwm rate -g 1 -r 0    
pwm rate -g 1 -r 400

I can confirm this bug on 1.12 beta 3. Set to 100Hz and measures 800Hz on the scope.
