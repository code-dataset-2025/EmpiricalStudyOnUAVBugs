Describe the bug    
V1.9.0_beta3 not connecting to QGC on MAC computer    
It does auto connect on Windows computer.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Use a MAC computer (10.14.x/Mojave), launch QGC.  
2.Connect MindPX(or MindRacer) to it, via USB.  
3.It does not connect.  
Expected behavior    
Should auto connect.  
Log Files and Screenshots    
No mavlink message bytes are received on QGC side, though cu/tty device has been created under /dev. QGC already identified correct port and port is opened, but no bytes received.  
Additional context    
It can auto connect on Windows computer. And previous release like v1.8.2 works well on MACOS/QGC.    
So it looks mostly like the new Nuttx usb cdc/acm driver compatibility issue. @davids5 @dagar

Thanks for the touch.  
I think it is a different one than \\\#12201    
This issue is not related to any external power source, and this issue does not exist on a Windows system.  
I did not test it against 1.9.2 yet, will let you know when I done.

@airmind ok. Do you have the startup console output when this fails?

I have tested against 1.9.2 and seems the issue still exists. Below is the startup output from a MindPX:

@davids5 do you see why mavlink on USB doesn't connect here? The log looks correct apart from the missing SD card.

@julianoes @airmind - nothing stands out. @airmind can you provide a copy of the dmesg output from the mac. With QGC running. Start with the FMU unplugged, then plug it in to USB. wait ~10 seconds then issue dmesg in a mac term window. The end of the log (last 11 seconds or so) is what I need to see.

I logged 2 sessions of dmesg output. Are they what your need?  
dmesg_output1.txt    
dmesg_output2.txt

Do you need a MindPX hardware to debug this issue? I can ship you one in a few days.    
This issue may or may not be platform specific, but a MindPX hardware can help to re-produce the problem for sure.  
Just let me know.    
Regards.

@airmind - sorry for the delay.  
I am not sure just the flight controller will help. I have a older MAC mini....  
I see nothing in the dmeg logs that I expected to see:  
Here is FMU V2 plugged in

```  
Is this logged on the MAC in syslog?

Do you mean system.log? No I did not see these message in /var/log/system.log    
I got the chance to grab a basic Pixhawk for testing, and shows random results that sometimes it can connect, and sometimes can not. In either cases, ttyusbmodem01 has been created under /dev.    
So seems to be a hardware platform independent issue.  
What is the MACOS version you are running in Mac mini?

You can launch it from Spotlight, or by clicking on the Apple symbol in the menubar and selecting "About the Mac" and then clicking "System Report...".    
    
If you select USB from the list of hardware types on the left-hand side, you will get some information about the USB devices plugged into your Mac including VendorID, ProductID and Manufacturer.    
What do you see under System report for USB devices?

Here is what I saw using a basic Pixhawk.... it does not connect.
