Describe the bug    
On the process of testing the micro RTPS bridge between a SITL client (with Gazebo) and the agent, I get the following warning msgs on the output of the nsh console:  
    
```bash     
 WARN  [px4] commander: px4_sem_timedwait failure: ret: 110, Connection timed out      
WARN  [cdev] commander: px4_poll() sem error: Success      
WARN  [px4] commander: px4_sem_timedwait failure: ret: 110, Connection timed out      
WARN  [cdev] commander: px4_poll() sem error: Success    
```  
which repeat themselves over time. The same does not happen if one builds the posix build using _default instead of _rtps.  
I am testing latest upstream master. This may have been introduced by the latest changes on SITL and with the lockstep feature.  
I am currently trying to find if this is just a warning or if this is introducing some sort of problem or breaking some functionality. Though, this wasn't happening before.  
@julianoes @MaEtUgR any tips on what's causing this?  
To Reproduce    
Platform: Ubuntu 18.04 with Gazebo 9.  
1.Clone upstream master;  
2.Issue make px4_sitl_rtps gazebo;  
3.Observe the above lines on the nsh console output.  
Expected behavior    
A clean console output.

Hm, two things are odd:  
1.Why does px4_poll time out?  
2.Why does it say sem error: Success.  
I think the first one we need to figure out for _rtps and the second one is probably just unclear user feedback.

Couple notes: Both happens when handling ETIMEDOUT. The definition of this is:  
\\\#define ETIMEDOUT       110     /* Connection timed out */  
I would look for sign errors (usage of 110 vs. -110) in the handling of the error. In particular around this section here:    
https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/73ed9deac507c86892afadee5bca2024b5b8da17/platforms/posix/src/px4_layer/px4_sem.cpp\\\#L143-L152

Ok. The problem is the following: errno != ret. Working on a patch. However: It might still suggest that something is off with RTPS because a timeout is happening.

Commit to blame is 98ae018 - I don't know why the errno change slipped through in the review, but it seems an unnecessary change.

Right, this was half improved. I thought it was pretty wrong (or at least odd) before. I'll clean it up.

I've added commits to \\\#11122, this should resolve 2.

The bottom line is important but while you're at it you should also add tone_alarm_sim which is missing.  
Then you'll see compile errors because you're using e.g. usleep which is poisoned and you're supposed to replace with px4_usleep, however, I could not actually find the source for that, so I leave that to you.

Thanks.  
I wasn't actually the author of the rtps build so any inputs on this are welcomed.
