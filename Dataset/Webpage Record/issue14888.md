Describe the bug    
When running the Ubuntu setup script (Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh) on Ubuntu 20.04, the script stops running at this line: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/0a4e7142ee7baa14cc50ea86d5a13b1933d5d5e4/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh\\\#L144  
To Reproduce    
Run the script on Ubuntu 20.04, after installing the NuttX dependencies it stops. When replacing the line linked above with GCC_FOUND_VER=0, the installation continues as expected.

@julianoes Not sure why but now I get this error before the toolchain installation:    
./ubuntu.sh: line 149: [: missing ]'    
And then the toolchain gets installed even though I already have it installed.    
It seems like I had the same problem in my original report (where I didn't have the toolchain already installed) but instead of printing the error message the script just finished without doing anything else.

I just tried this in a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 docker and it worked just fine.  
How did you download your ubuntu.sh file? Can you try the one downloaded with the repository?

I used a fresh download of the repository and launched the script from there.    
Maybe the version of bash I am using (5.0.16(1)-release) behaves differently than yours?

@julianoes I can reproduce in a VM - see duplicate \\\#14916  
I think it is something to do with the Grep of the version and the addition of "+x" but I don't understand this bit of the code. Hoping you can work out why it is falling over.

Sorry, I overlooked the error. Now I can reproduce it.
