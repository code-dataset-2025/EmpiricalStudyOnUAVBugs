It's the cast align warning (-Werror=cast-align). What we really need to do is update this build and get it in the CI system. I'd like to either bring librobotcontrol in as a submodule or via cmake ExternalProject. We should also be able to dump the native/cross configs. A single default can work for both with the architecture specified.

You can work around a warning by removing -Werror for now here:
