Describe the bug  
The git repo contains a .vscode folder with custom vscode settings in settings.json. This interferes with user-chosen settings.  
Please, do not force your personal editor settings on other users.  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.right-click in vscode terminal  
2.text from the clipboard is pasted  
Expected behavior  
By default, a context menu should open.  
Additional context  
The specific right-click behaviour is caused by "terminal.integrated.rightClickBehavior": "paste", in the .vscode/settings.json. There are a couple more settings that overrule a user's preferences.
