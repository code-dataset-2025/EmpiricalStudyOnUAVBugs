Describe the bug    
A multicopter does not go to the correct takeoff altitude but actually lower, presumably it is MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT - NAV_MC_ALT_RAD because once it "reaches" takeoff altitude it switches to HOLD and doesn't keep climbing.  
To Reproduce    
SITL:  
    
```bash     
 param set NAV_RCL_ACT 0        
param set NAV_DLL_ACT 0        
param set MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT 2.5        
commander takeoff        
listener local_position -n 1        
```  
To "fix" it, set the threshold smaller:  
    
```bash     
 param set NAV_MC_ALT_RAD 0.05        
```  
Expected behavior    
It should go to the correct altitude as it used to.

It's still off by 5cm but it doesn't seem to depend on the mentioned param anymore. Closing.
