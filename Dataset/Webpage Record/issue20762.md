1.Hold oscilloscope probe to TX pin of TELEM1 port.  
2.See no data coming through.  
3.Hold Probe to TX pin of TELEM3 port.  
4.See data.  
Expected behavior  
Data coming through TELEM1.

It gets weirder:  
A while back, I wrote a module that communicates via TELEM3 port. Today, I altered it to use TELEM1 port instead to test the TELEM1 port and I get the following weird behavior:    
After booting, there is no data coming through the TX pin of TELEM1. Then I start my module via the MAVLink console in QGC by typing "my_module_name start". Within the start function of my module, it opens the corresponding uart port of TELEM1, but, at this point, it does not write any data! However, as soon as I start my module, I can see data coming through the TX pin of TELEM1 in my oscilloscope with a baudrate of 57600. Now, I can stop my module again by typing "my_module_name stop" and the data will keep coming.  
So, opening the uart port in a different module must somehow enable MAVLink to use this port. I have no idea where to look to fix this issue.

For testing, I installed Ardupilot on the Pixhawk 6X and here the TELEM1 port works without a problem.

Does it work with stock PX4 v1.13.2 flashed without your changes, with the appropriate default params set?  
    
```bash     
 MAV_0_CONFIG 101        
MAV_0_FLOW_CTRL 2        
MAV_0_MODE 0        
MAV_0_RADIO_CTL 1        
MAV_0_RATE 1200        
SER_TEL1_BAUD 57600        
```  
If the stock image works, then I would say this is an issue with your code additions/changes. Without seeing them it would then be hard for anyone to diagnose the problem

I flashed version 1.13.2 directly from within QGC and it still does not work.

That's with the parameters reset?

I cannot confirm right now but I wanna say I am pretty sure that I resetted them when I tried version v1.13.2.

I am facing the same issue. I have tested the stock PX4 v1.13.2 on Pixhawk 6x and Telem 1 does not work. To debug I did the following:  
1.To make sure the board isn't damaged I flashed PX4 v1.12.3 on Pixhawk 6x and the telem 1 works fine.  
2.To verify if the stock PX4 v1.13.2 firmware, I flashed it on Pixhawk 5x and again telem 1 works fine.  
In conclusion, this bug is only with Pixhawk 6x in combination with the stock PX4 v1.13.2 firmware version.  
@FriedrichTuttas let me know if I can help in any way. If needed I can do some more tests to debug this issue.

@ashu41 can you try with params reset? Or can you post the params that you have set?

Yes, I have tried params reset. Here is the param file:

@ashu41 Thank you for your input! This gives me the peace of mind that it was not just me. :D I did some more digging in the firmware source code searching for modules that use the TELEM1 port or use a baud rate of 57600 but I could not find anything suspicious. I thought that maybe the error stems from the fact that the uart port numbering changed. In the Pixhawk 4, the TELEM1 port was /dev/ttyS1 (source) while it is /dev/ttyS6 on the Pixhawk 6x (source). I also had a look at the startup procedure for MAVLink but that all seemed alright to me as well. Therefore, I do not know where else to look.

I am also stuck with this bug and unable to figure out the source problem. I have 10 Pixhawk 6X boards but can't use it. I am hoping @julianoes and other PX4 devs will resolve this soon.

In conclusion, this bug is only with Pixhawk 6x in combination with the stock PX4 v1.13.2 firmware version.    
I also tested v1.13.0 and v1.13.1 and have the same error there. @ashu41, you said that it worked in v1.12.3. So, the error must have been introduced with the changes between v1.12 and v.1.13.

@ashu41 have you tried more than one board? Just to rule out a hardware problem.  
And can you confirm this is with default params?

Although, you already said that it would work at v1.12, so that speaks against hardware indeed.

I just verified this with v1.13.2 and it works fine for my Holybro 6X with default (bigger) baseboard. I have a telemetry radio connected to Telem1 to test this, and it works out of the box after a param reset_all.

Interesting. I just tested it again. Here is my extensive step-by-step procedure (in case I messed something up):  
1.Start QGC.  
2.Go to Vehicle Setup -> Firmware  
3.Connect Pixhawk 6X to computer through USB and wait until it is recognized by QGC.  
4."PX4 Pro Stable Release v1.13.2" is pre-selected. I do not change that and click OK to start flashing the new firmware.  
5.Wait until the flashing process is completed and the board has reconnected to QGC.  
6.Go to Analyze Tools -> MAVLink Console.  
7.Issue command param reset_all. I exported the parameters after the reset to this file.  
8.Unplug the USB cable of the Pixhawk 6X.  
9.Connect telemetry radio to TELEM1 port, connect the other telemetry radio to a USB port of my computer.  
10.Connect the USB port of Pixhawk 6X to power using an adapter for an AC power socket (so as not to connect it to the computer via USB).  
11.QGC will not connect to the Pixhawk 6X. Also, the LED on the telemetry radio connected to the Pixhawk 6X that is supposed to indicate transmission of data does not flash at all. Also, I cannot see any data on the TELEM1 port's TX pin in my oscilloscope.  
I tested this on the Pixhawk 6X with the default and the mini baseboard. Same result. With the default baseboard, I continued to test the TELEM3 port with the following steps:  
12.Unplug telemetry radio from the TELEM1 port.  
13.Connect Pixhawk 6X to computer through USB and wait until it is recognized by QGC.  
14.Go to Vehicle Setup -> Parameters.  
15.Search for "mav" and change the parameter MAV_0_CONFIG from TELEM1 to TELEM3.  
16.Unplug the USB cable of the Pixhawk 6X.  
17.Connect telemetry radio to TELEM3 port.  
18.Connect the USB port of Pixhawk 6X to power using an adapter for an AC power socket.  
19.After a few seconds, QGC will connect to the Pixhawk 6X through the telemetry radio. Its LED flashes indicating data transmission and the oscilloscope confirms data on the TELEM3 port's TX pin.  
So, with my Pixhawk 6X on PX4 v1.13.2, TELEM3 works and TELEM1 does not.  
To confirm again, I repeated the first 10 steps, but instead of flashing PX4 on step 4, I flashed Ardupilot (leaving all the dropdowns as their default value), and I omitted steps 6 and 7. Running Ardupilot, the QGC will connect to the Pixhawk 6X through its TELEM1 port without a problem. So, it should not be a hardware problem.  
@ashu41 can you confirm that you get the same results following these steps?

Thanks @FriedrichTuttas. I followed your exact steps. I also exported my params and they were identical apart from the GYRO calibration bias. For me MAVLink on Telem1 is flowing as expected.  
Can you share the output of mavlink status? You can just get that using MAVLink shell via USB.  
For me, it's as follows when connected via radio:  
    
```bash

And what telemetry radio are you using? Is it one that does have all 6 wires used, with flow control?

My output from mavlink status looks quite different (even though I made sure to issue param reset_all and restart the Pixhawk beforehand):

I am using this telemetry radio. The cable that came with it had all six wires but I cannot tell whether all of them are actually used on the board. However, even if nothing is connected to TELEM1, I cannot see data on the TX pin in my oscilloscope. This leads me to believe that this behavior is not the radio's fault.

I'm using a Holybro Telemetry radio btw. I'll try if it works connecting just Rx/Tx and GND of an FTDI cable next.

I believe I can reproduce it. I connected an FTDI cable with the flow control pins not connected, and I see only incoming bytes right at startup, then it stops.  
    
```bash     
 instance \\\\#0:        
        mavlink chan: \\\\#0        
        type:           GENERIC LINK OR RADIO        
        flow control: ON        
        rates:        
          tx: 0.0 B/s        
          txerr: 0.0 B/s        
          tx rate mult: 0.850        
          tx rate max: 1200 B/s        
          rx: 0.0 B/s        
          rx loss: 0.0%        
        FTP enabled: YES, TX enabled: YES

        MAVLink version: 1        
        transport protocol: serial (/dev/ttyS6 @57600)        
```  
It looks like flow control is ON even though the flow control pins are not connected, so it presumably stops transmitting once the buffers are full.  
If I set MAV_0_FLOW_CTRL to 0 to force flow control off, it starts working.  
The default is 2, so AUTO, but that seems not to work appropriately.

And I can confirm that the flow control detection seems to work fine on Telem 3 but not Telem 1. The problem seems to be the same in main.

I found that disabling DMA for Rx and Tx solves the the problem.

Nice! I can confirm that the TELEM1 port works if I set MAV_0_FLOW_CTRL to "force off" (=0) and/or disable DMA for UART7. Thanks a lot for your investigative work! 👏  
Since you could only reproduce my issues after disconnecting the flow control pins, am I correct to assume that the reason for us to experience a different behavior at first is that your telemetry radio actually uses the flow control pins and mine does not? If so, you should also not be able to see data on the TX pin if there is nothing attached to the TELEM1 port. Do you by chance have an oscilloscope at hand to confirm this? 😃  
Do you believe that DMA is the root cause of this problem? I noticed that, for fmu-v5x, DMA is also not enabled on USART2 (which is the TELEM1 port of the Pixhawk 4).

@julianoes It could be that with DMA and CTS floating. CTS is HIGH (not clear to send) If we add a pull down on the CTS GPIO in the PIN init, that my resolve it.

I think so. I'd suggest you open up yours and check it.

Correct.

DMA in itself should work but something must be misconfigured. I'll try what @davids5 suggested.

Is that the right place to address it? And should I do it for all U(S)ARTs?

No.  See the note at the bottom  
That is the SoC defines not the board usage. The assignment and modifications go in board.h  
We should never effect other designs (board) It should be done in our the board.h for the boards that needs it.
