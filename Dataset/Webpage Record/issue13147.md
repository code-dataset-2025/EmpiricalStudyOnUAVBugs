Describe the bug    
Cannot fly my holybro s500 kit with master. It works fine on v1.9.2. I've also tracked this on px4 discuss here.  
To Reproduce    
Using this holybro s500 kit: https://shop.holybro.com/_p1153.html  
Expected behavior    
There should be no ESC issues between PX4 firmware versions. There is funny business happening on the actuator outputs during boot.  
Below are screenshots of a scope on motor output 1 during first 1 second of boot.  
Log Files and Screenshots    
v1.9.2    
master    
As you can see in the images above, v1.9.2 has 5 pulses of 900us width spaced at 20ms before the 400hz 900us outputs actually kick on. I am not sure if this is related, but it was the only thing I found.  
Additional context    
This has been broken for a while now, I'd really like to be able to fly master...

I have requested hardware so that I can help with this. but I will not be able to work on it till after I return on the 16th.

We should have an assembled set. Let me check.  
EDIT: It's in use, that would mean ours is still flying on master. I'll have to check when it's available again.

ould mean ours is s    
@MaEtUgR could you try through a range of typical configurations?  
- 400 Hz PWM  
- OneShot  
- DShot

Considering no one else but me is having this issue, I wonder about the ESC firmware. This might be something we ask Holybro about. Also Holybro has multiple ESC models, and I am not sure which model these are, the website does not list it.

It would be helpful to get a high-rate log, set this by enabling the flag in SDLOG_PROFILE, get a log with 1.9.2, do the same on master, and then upload the logs to compare.

I'm currently trying to reproduce. Attached one of these black heat shrink ESCs of an S500 to a pixhawk 4, chose quad x and tried force arming and running pwm test. First result: The signal is on IO by default but @dakejahl mentioned he has the problem on fmu so I should probably load the S500 airframe config.

@dakejahl mentioned he has the problem on fmu    
Sorry I think I misunderstood the question on the dev-call, I am indeed connected via IO PWM OUT

Finally I got it working, I had some old custom mixer on the SD card of the flight control that screwed me up. Now I tried spinning the motor without prop on 1.9.2 and master and it looks exactly the same to me. I can do further tests tomorrow.

Yup looks like mine. I opened up the heat shrink and unfortunately there's not really much silk screen info.

Is there anyone from HolyBro that can join this conversation? I'm like 90% sure this is a firmware bug that they probably know about and have fixed if we have the same hardware and yours works and mine doesn't.

Using the pwm test -p 1600 -a works great, motors all spin correctly. I'll post a log of highr rate data once I am able to test with master. I am currently blocked by an erroneous  "heading estimate not stable, preflight checks failed" on master ... not sure why because if I flash 1.9.2 I can fly around with no issues.

"heading estimate not stable, preflight checks failed"    
had it once as well, @bresch fixed it in \\\#13261  
If it's changing from 1.9.2 to master it has to be a software caused problem. Currently I think the vibrations getting amplified is the most plausible one since I didn't have the fc mounted to the fram -> no vibrations and your pwm test also runs fine. You could try throttling up a bit with much lower MC_(ROLL,PITCH,YAW)RATE_K gain and check if your problem is gone. Be aware that you might not be able to fly in a stable fashion with much lower gains.  
@dakejahl It would be really helpful to debug if you could like @jkflying suggested provide a high rate log and a short video showing how the symptom actually looks like such that we are sure it's there are no misunderstandings.

@MaEtUgR I've got the FC isolated on a little vibe isolation mount with damping bulbs but I think you're correct.  
1.9.2    
You can actually still see the effects of vibration on the motor output at high throttle. And I can indeed hear the bad sounds the motors make near high throttle.

master    
Yup this is totally messed up. I am surprised I couldn't see this with low rate logging.    
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=dccabbd4-65cd-4efd-bd10-421a9504dfb4  
I guess my big question is: Why? Is this a consequence of running the rates controller at a higher frequency? What can I do to fix this? Why am I the only person who has experienced this? (does everyone else have baller vibration damping? üòâ )

@dakejahl that looks like crazy vibrations on gyro and accel, wow! I don't understand where it comes from. Is there a chance you could do a git bisect to try to figure out when it was introduced?

Ha... of course the very first commit from git bisect doesn't even work. Can't arm, vehicle doesn't see RC.  
ea48cd4 looks like px4io is failing to start on this commit. Enabled it manually and am able to arm, but the motors don't spin so something else is wrong here as well.  
Any tips?

@dakejahl you can do git bisect skip and try the next commit.

Sad day... while testing during a bisect, the vehicle flipped itself and smashed on the ground destroying two props. Unfortunately I need to order some more, my spares are incompatible with these motors.

Here's a bench test with no props attached, I arm the vehicle and let it idle for a little bit, then ramp up the throttle to 0.5 and then back down to idle.  
1.9.2    
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=bf9f4248-a7e5-42dd-9f83-e60df970ad0a    
master    
https://review.px4.io/plot_app?log=eccaa7ec-6fb8-4e93-88dd-9689243c1c05    
You can clearly see the raw gyro/accel go absolutely nuts on master as soon as there is more than idle throttle.  
Now the hard part here is determining cause/effect. I did a diff git diff v1.9.2 master -- src/drivers/imu/mpu6000/ and nothing changes functionally with the driver (20689 is crammed in with mpu600). I verified on the bench that the sensor is being selected correctly and that the data more or less looks the same when you poke it. Also notice the vibration levels between 1.9.2 and master are pretty much the same at idle throttle, the data really only gets bad when you throttle up.  
This leads me to believe the crazy vibrations are real vibrations -- caused by the shuddering of the motors (Video of shuddering). If you take a closer look at the actuator outputs, you can see on master the output values do not increase smoothly, but are rather jagged.

Changing IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF from 80 back to 30 solved the issue üòï  
I can't remember why I changed it away from default in the first place.... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (I think it was early on during bringup and it was flying like crap and someone suggested to change the gyro cutoff). But still concerning that there is such a large difference in behavior between two versions. Any ideas?

That's not really concerning because we've changed the filtering pipeline to accommodate high-performance racers so that the cutoff setting is more effective. I'll let @bkueng / @bresch chime in, but that frame has a lot of flex and so what I'm seeing here is what I would expect with 30 vs 80 Hz cutoff.

Thanks for doing the extra work to verify this @dakejahl.  
@bkueng @bresch, please close this issue if you can verify @LorenzMeier conclusion, we need to move on with the v1.10 release.

@mrpollo I think we still need to find the cause of the issue, lowering the cutoff just hides the underlying possible issue.    
This is why the bisect is really important to helping us finding the modifications that leads to the change of behavior.  
@dakejahl any news?

Unfortunately I can't continue the bisect with the s500 until I get some new props. I'm going to setup my 250 airframe in the mean time and see if I can't reproduce the issue. Travelling this week so I'll be back on it the following week.

Here is another example of a frame with a lot of vibration and presumably overdriven motors:
