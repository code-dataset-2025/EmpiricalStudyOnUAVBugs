Describe the bug    
A clear and concise description of the bug.    
I was trying to bind the parameter to (using parameter tuning in QGroundcontrol) to my low-medium-high settings of a 3-way switch, but only got    
low:    
medium:    
high:    
Please advice.

Thanks for the issue. I have the feeling the parameter tuning using a know was never tested/used for params with int type (not float). Feel free to debug it in code, maybe in HITL simulation. I'm not sure when someone else would look into this.  
It's an interesting idea though to use the tuning knob functionality in this way.

Hi Julian,    
thanks for your response...I suspected something like that. However, thinking the other way around: Within ArduCopter there is a continuous paramter called RNGFND_GAIN, which essentially interpolates between the height measured by the baro sensor and the rangefinder. WouldnÂ´t such a paramter make sense in the PX4 environment?

I don't know where a parameter like that would fit into the control and ekf2 set-up.  
I would say we should fix the actual bug that you found here.
