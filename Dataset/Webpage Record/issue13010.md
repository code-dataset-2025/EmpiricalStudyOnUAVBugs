Describe the bug    
FW throttle goes briefly to 0 after front transition is completed (see screenshot below).  
The reason for this bug probably is that vtol_attitude controller listens to the throttle setpoint from the attitude controller before this one is initialized to the correct value after the transition (https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/41516fbd5532cdb5c8beb2e519ca4d8e5247a579/src/modules/vtol_att_control/standard.cpp\\\#L460).    
vtol_att begins to set throttle equal to whatever fw_att_controller publishes after _vtol_schedule.flight_mode is set to FW_MODE, which is done in update_vtol_state().  
To Reproduce    
Do a transition in SITL, look at the logs (see below).  
Expected behavior    
throttle should go from transition throttle to user commanded (stabilized mode) or to throttle output from TECS.

This probably surfaced with the recent wq changes @dagar , and it shows once more how hacky our current vtol architecture is.  
FYI @RomanBapst

Looks like this issue was related to \\\#13030, respective the PR that fixed that (\\\#13031).    
Closing.
