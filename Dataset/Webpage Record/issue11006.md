Describe the bug    
In master the catkin package builds but the targets are not correctly installed. This could possibly be due to installing all of the targets in the binary directory using the cmake directory install instead of the cmake target install.  
To Reproduce  
    
```bash     
 mkdir -p ~/px4_catkin/src      
cd ~/px4_catkin_src      
git clone git@github.com:PX4/Firmware px4      
cd  ~/px4_catkin      
catkin build      
. ./devel/setup.bash      
rosrun px4 px4      
[rosrun] Couldn't find executable named px4 below /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4      
[rosrun] Found the following, but they're either not files,      
[rosrun] or not executable:      
[rosrun]   /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4      
[rosrun]   /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4/boards/px4      
[rosrun]   /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4/Tools/jMAVSim/jMAVlib/src/me/drton/jmavlib/log/px4      
[rosrun]   /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4/src/lib/DriverFramework/framework/px4      
[rosrun]   /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4/platforms/posix/lib/px4      
[rosrun]   /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4/msg/lib/px4      
[rosrun]   /home/jgoppert/git/catkin_px4/src/px4/msg/templates/px4    
```  
Expected behavior  
    
```bash     
 rosrun px4 px4      
```  
This should work but the executable is not found.

I believe it's all here if you'd like to fix it - https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/platforms/posix/CMakeLists.txt\\\#L75-L180  
The only thing that we actually need to keep at the moment is a basic SITL package for the mission tests deployed to each build slave, although it would be great to have working packages for things like the raspberry pi as well.    
http://ci.px4.io:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/PX4_misc%2FFirmware-SITL_tests/detail/master/434/pipeline  
Any behaviour you'd like to preserve needs at least a very simple test added to the CI system. https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Jenkinsfile\\\#L9-L64

We used to test this in CI, if we fix this, would be good to add CI back as well.

Yeah. @TSC21 added it a while back. Getting it back shouldn't be a problem

Yeah. @TSC21 added it a while back. Getting it back shouldn't be a problem    
The only thing I added was a catkin (and a colcon) build lines, but there isn't any test that's actually running inside a ROS workspace. And that's what me and @jgoppert have been trying to fix past couple of days. PX4 Firmware builds inside a catkin workspace but it's not usable whatsoever in a ROS environment

@dagar We have been working around those same lines but seems that every change we do has repercussions and creates a cascade of errors throughout the generated code we are trying to build. It seems that setting the PX4_BINARY_DIR as we currently do has a negative effect for catkin in what concerns to absolute vs relative paths.  
Your input is welcomed here. Thanks!

Is RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY the problem?

At this point, I don't know what is the problem.

Ahh. I see what you mean.

I am at a point I need to get this working so I'll spend some time looking into it.

@dagar It is the CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY. Do we need to do this?

This fixes it for ROS. I'm sure this would have a lot of packaging implications for you @dagar so let me know how you want to proceed.
