Works fine on Mac here as well after all clean actions (make and git). I'm on stack_abstraction which is a branch addressing a few OS-specific stack size issues. It might be worthwhile for you to try as well.

The file Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/iris/iris.sdf was not re-generated/updated.  
The following resolved the problem:  
    
```bash     
 cd Tools/sitl_gazebo        
git clean -d -f -x        
```

@julianoes Try make distclean next time. I use it when jumping between branches with big changes, especially when submodules have been added/deleted/url changed.
