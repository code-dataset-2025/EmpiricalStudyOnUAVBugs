Describe the bug    
Between v1.6.5 and v1.8.0 there seems to have been quite a lot of changes to the PWM state machine, or I just never delved into this code before. It took me a couple of days but I have narrowed it down to src/drivers/px4fmu/fmu.cpp where there is both a publish and a subscribe to the uORB topic actuators_armed. It is perhaps intended to be generic to the situation where there is no safety button.  
What happens is that the orb_check() call on _sub_safety never returns an update, for whatever reason (i.e. updated = false). This bug was particularly difficult to find, because mostly everything seemed normal -- and there was no error message, since the logic that is supposed to notify you that you're trying to arm with the safety on is actually not in this same place. (And the safety was of course not on.)  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Run PX4 v1.8.0 as released with Pixracer board, px4fmu v4.  
2.Try to start motors  
3.Armed and running light comes on (steady red) and PWM signal is at idle.  
Expected behavior    
Motors to spin.  
I will forego the rest of the details as I believe this is more than enough information to fix this problem. I'm however not sure why this hasn't happened to you all.

I don't think what I am about to suggest is the way to go, but it serves as a way around the problem without diving into why uORB isn't doing what is expected.  
I simply let _safety_off = _safety_btn_off if GPIO_BTN_SAFETY is defined, otherwise use the orb_check() stuff. This lets the code be agnostic to what type of safety switch is used and yet removes this complication that resulted in a fairly serious bug.

@PX4/testflights could you describe your pixracer and nxphlite setups? Are you using the safety button in either?

@lericson I'd like to move the safety button handling out of px4fmu entirely. \\\#10119

I would recommend to use a kill switch for that use case. Disarming is meant for fully tuned, autonomous operation.
