Describe the bug  
While flying a VTOL mission in simulator with WPs with large altitude difference close together (to provoke loiter to altitude), I experienced that the drone after completing loiter to altitude (WP 4) selected the WP after the next (WP 6, but currently unsure if WP 5 was briefly selected in between) but continued straight east, but adjusting the altitude to that given in WP 5.  
To Reproduce  
I have not been able to reproduce yet, but the steps I did when got the error is given below.  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Started simulator make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol  
2.Uploaded mission bumpy.zip  
3.Started mission  
4.Error after WP 4, as described/shown in screenshot  
Expected behavior  
The drone should have gone to WP 5 and loitered to corrected altitude after WP 4.  
Log Files and Screenshots

Drone (please complete the following information):  
- Simulator, gazebo_standard_vtol  
Additional context  
Used latest main branch version:    
0ae296bfe21add6276f5c28a97884059fb317999    
Build/run in px4io/px4-dev-simulation-focal docker image.  
After the screenshot was taken, I selected WP 6 and continued mission from there. No unexpected behavior after this.

@kibidev Behaviorwise this looks like a similar problem that \\\#18996 fixed

Got an other data point:    
It actually changes WPs here, but is flying at wrong position in a line, when it should be loitering.  
Edit:    
Log: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=1fc36355-0265-4f81-a060-bdb2341135fd    
Plan: bumpy2.zip  
Edit 2:    
This new plan seem to be easier to reproduce, I suspect the key is to get the WPs very close together. It still does not happen every time, though.

Thanks @Jaeyoung-Lim, this does indeed seem relevant.    
I will investigate a bit more, and try to pinpoint which versions are impacted.

I have not been able to reproduce this in 1.13.2, so I believe some change after this is the cause, but I can not be 100 % sure.

Using bisect, I have found the commit/PR that first causes this behavior:    
\\\#21168  
I have not studied it in details, but I suspect that there is some other older code that is the actual error, and this just stopped hiding the problem.

There might be something with this function:    
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/fw_path_navigation/FixedwingPositionControl.cppLines 2821 to 2856  
      in0afda91*/void FixedwingPositionControl::navigateWaypoints ( const Vector2f &waypoint_A, const Vector2f &waypoint_B, const Vector2f &vehicle_pos, const Vector2f &ground_vel, const Vector2f &wind_vel) { // similar to logic found in ECL_L1_Pos_Controller method of same name // BUT no arbitrary max approach angle, approach entirely determined by generated // bearing vectors Vector2f vector_A_to_B = waypoint_B - waypoint_A; Vector2f vector_A_to_vehicle = vehicle_pos - waypoint_A; if (vector_A_to_B. norm () < FLT_EPSILON) { // the waypoints are on top of each other and should be considered as a // single waypoint, fly directly to it if (vector_A_to_vehicle. norm () > FLT_EPSILON) { vector_A_to_B = -vector_A_to_vehicle; } else { // Fly to a point and on it. Stay to the current control. Do not update the npfg library to get last output. return ; } } else if ((vector_A_to_B. dot (vector_A_to_vehicle) < -FLT_EPSILON)) { // we are in front of waypoint A, fly directly to it until we are within switch distance. if (vector_A_to_vehicle. norm () > _npfg. switchDistance ( 500 . 0f )) { vector_A_to_B = -vector_A_to_vehicle; } } // track the line segment Vector2f unit_path_tangent{vector_A_to_B. normalized ()}; _target_bearing = atan2f ( unit_path_tangent ( 1 ), unit_path_tangent ( 0 )); _closest_point_on_path = waypoint_A + vector_A_to_vehicle. dot (unit_path_tangent) * unit_path_tangent; _npfg. guideToPath (vehicle_pos, ground_vel, wind_vel, unit_path_tangent, waypoint_A, 0 . 0f ); } // navigateWaypoints  
```  
Line 2843 seems strange to me, as it should intuitive be a positive dot product that indicates that vehicle is in front of A. Am I missing something? However, just flipping just makes the drone circle around a point on the line between A and B.  
Using loiter radius instead of FLT_EPSILON on 2831 does seem to work, but I guess that is mostly for this special case, and not really the right way to do it.

Thanks for the report @kibidev , sadly I only saw it now. I was able to reproduce and now look for a solution with the hints you already posted.    
(PS feel free to ping me or another maintainer on issues/PRs if you don't get a reply fast, the real issues like this one are otherwise easy to miss with all the other noise we get)
