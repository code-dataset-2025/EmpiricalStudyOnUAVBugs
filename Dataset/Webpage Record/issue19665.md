Describe the bug    
When I run HITL with Pixhawk 4, Gazebo 11 and PX4 v1.13.0-beta1 (or master), the simulation failed to Tx queue overflow after it connects to the USB port.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Plug the Pixhawk 4 with PX4 v1.13.0-beta1 and HITL airframe config to USB port  
2.Wait the Pixhawk 4 to boot  
3.Run the command gzserver --verbose Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds/hitl_iris.world  
4.See error:  
    
```bash     
 gzserver --verbose Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds/hitl_iris.world

...        
```  
Expected behavior    
Gazebo should not go to this Tx queue overflow and we should see the drone in QGC through UDP  
Additional context    
I tried also with master branch, with new install of Ubuntu 20.04, with new Pixhawk 4 but I always get this same error. With v1.12.3 it works fine with Gazebo. Also with v1.13.0-beta1 or master HITL works fine with jmavsim so I guess the issue comes from Gazebo

I can reproduce the issue, looking into it.

Ok, I found the reason. This reason is that the mavlink instance on the Pixhawk's USB is no longer running by default but is started when it detects an incoming MAVLink heartbeat. It turns out that Gazebo HITL does not send any heartbeats so then the mavlink instance on the PX4 side is not started and Gazebo just fills it's Tx buffer.  
The auto-detection happens here:   
```cpp   
 /*PX4-Autopilot/platforms/nuttx/src/px4/common/cdc_acm_check.cppLines 224 to 236  
      in887fe7d*/} else if ((buffer[i] == 0xFD ) && (buffer[i + 1 ] == 9 ) && (buffer[i + 7 ] == 0 ) && (buffer[i + 8 ] == 0 ) && (buffer[i + 9 ] == 0 )) { // mavlink v2 HEARTBEAT // buffer[0]: start byte (0xFD for mavlink v2) // buffer[1]: length (9 for HEARTBEAT) // buffer[5]: SYSID // buffer[6]: COMPID // buffer[7:9]: mavlink message id (0 for HEARTBEAT) syslog (LOG_INFO, " %s: launching mavlink (HEARTBEAT v2 from SYSID:%d COMPID:%d) \n " , USB_DEVICE_PATH, buffer[i + 5 ], buffer[i + 6 ]); launch_mavlink = true ; break ; }  
```  
To fix this, I enabled sending heartbeats on the Gazebo side. However, sending a heartbeat every second was not enough, because all the buffers might get filled with HITL data in less than a second which then again leads to the situation where the mavlink instance is not started.    
Therefore, I'm sending the heartbeat in every iteration until we receive a heartbeat which tells us PX4 is talking back.  
Fixed in PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic\\\#863.

Hello, @julianoes,  
I am still facing this problem when I am customizing my own gazebo model but connecting with Pixhawk mini.  
I am using the same setting of mavlink plugin in the iris.sdf. And following what stated on the setting of HITL, the problem of :Tx queue overflow still appeared.  
Any solutions or suggetion are welcomed!!!!!

Hello, I merged my model into the Tools/sitl_gazebo/model under PX4.  
When I ran my model HITL, it still shows â€œTx queue overflow"  
I have four rotors sticked on four rotational arms, I am not sure whether it makes overflow.

Tx queue overflow    
This often happens if the configured serial port is not the right one.

Thanks, @julianoes  
Sometimes it works well, sometimes overflows.

By the way, I didn't change any serial port settings, sometimes it can work. What should I do if I want to make sure it works every time?

Whatever you connect to the PC first, will have /dev/ttyACM0 and sometimes the port might still be blocked because it's still open by QGC or something else and hence you'll get /dev/ttyACM1. That would explain it.  
If you want to avoid dealing with these instance numbers, just use the path by id which doesn't change, e.g.: /dev/serial/by-id/... and put that one in the sdf.

@julianoes , every time I change the model into the Iris, it works, but when using my more complex model, it shows overflow.

Based on what I did, I don't think it is a problem of port, because when I used a quadrotor with four tiltable rotors, it shows overflow, but when I used a common quadrotor, everything is fine.

Do you change the port for when you use other non Iris models?

No, I didn't change.    
What I did was just change the vehicle name in the launch file, and the Iris model works pretty well every time.

This issue has been mentioned on Discussion Forum for PX4, Pixhawk, QGroundControl, MAVSDK, MAVLink. There might be relevant details there:

when I used a quadrotor with four tiltable rotors, it shows overflow, but when I used a common quadrotor, everything is fine.    
Now that I read it again, this sounds most likely like just the sheer amount of topic being sent over from Gazebo through the mavlink interface library to the Pixhawk is filling up the TX buffer.

Hi, Junwoo,  
Sorry to reply you late.  
It seems your analysis is reasonable. I just add extra four inputs for tilting the rotors in the SDF file using my custom CAD model following the template of iris.sdf. No extra changes. Multiple attempts may result in one success.  
    
Could you submit a PR for this change?    
I haven't finished this project, sorry I can't submit a PR.
