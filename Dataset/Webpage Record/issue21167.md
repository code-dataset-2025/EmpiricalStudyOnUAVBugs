Describe the bug  
I have problem running successfully the offboard_control script on real hardware  
Drone :  
- Holybro v5  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:    
On pixhawk:  
1.I flashed the pixhawk from the stable release/1.13 setting the CONFIG_MODULES_MICRODDS_CLIENT=n  parameter in ~/PX4-Autopilot/boards/px4/fmu-v5/rtps.px4board  
2.I set the RTPS_CONFIG parameter to TELEM2, and then SER_TEL2_BAUD to 921600 8N1.  
On pc:  
1.I build the px4_ros_com workspace from the release/1.13 branch with the following output.    
output(2).txt    
To notice that the building always gives at the end  1 package had stderr output: px4_ros_com but without saying where  the error comes from.  
2.Connect TELEM2 and my pc through serial.  
3.run rtps agent with micrortps_agent -t UART -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 921600 getting the following output  
    
```bash     
 --- MicroRTPS Agent ---        
[   micrortps_agent   ]	Starting link...        
[   micrortps_agent   ]	UART transport: device: /dev/ttyUSB0; baudrate: 921600; poll: 1ms; flow_control: No

-----------------------        
```  
5.Now, if I run the sensor_combined_listener, I correctly get the data, however if I run the offboard_control, I get the following output but I cannot arm the drone.  
    
```bash     
 Starting offboard control node...        
[INFO] [1676882384.131341654] [offboard_control]: Arm command send        
```

Hi, Could you share the flight log?

Silly mistake. By default, the remote controller has to be connected to the px4, otherwise offboard control is not allowed.    
Anyway I have a couple of questions.  
- I know it is not recommended, but if I want to deactivate that by default the remote controller has to be connected, which parameter should I change?  
- If you had a look at the build output of the  px4_ros_com workspace, do you have an idea from where the 1 package had stderr output: px4_ros_com comes from?
