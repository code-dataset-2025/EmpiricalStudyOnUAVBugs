Describe the bug  
It is a simulation issue.    
I use the sample code from this : MAVROS Offboard control example | PX4 User Guide    
In the past, it took off vertically and can complete a triangle trajectory    
However, it suddenly goes wrongly with this error, and sometimes with lots of Preflight check error    
[health_and_arming_checks] Preflight Fail: High Accelerometer Bias    
Then the drone cannot take off or    
sometimes take off not vertically like the below video. https://youtu.be/rcNdcXxstQU  
similar issue ref: https://discuss.px4.io/t/simulation-take-off-motion-not-vertical/30705/4  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch  
2.cd /PX4-Autopilot/integrationtests/python_src/px4_it/mavros/  
3.python2 mavros_offboard_posctl_test.py  
Expected behavior  
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.  
Log Files and Screenshots  
The drone take off but not vertically: https://youtu.be/rcNdcXxstQU    
The issue happened when  
    
```bash     
 roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch         
roslaunch px4 posix_sitl.launch        
```  
The sample code trajectory becomes not perfect triangle.    
I noticed that if using roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch the issue happened after one flight    
However, if using make px4_sitl gazebo, there is no issue. I can control the drone to take off vertically with QGroundcontrol, ref: Gazebo Vehicles | PX4 User Guide  
The same issue happens when running roslaunch px4 posix_sitl.launch and take off with QGroundControl    
The same issue happens in a real drone, Too many false positive "Preflight Fail: HIGH IMU ACCEL BIAS" warning messages · Issue \\\#10833 · PX4/PX4-Autopilot · GitHub  
I also notice the rostopic echo /mavros/imu/data    
similar issue ref: /mavros/imu/data linear_acceleration abnormal · Issue \\\#1133 · mavlink/mavros · GitHub  
The abnormal y- acceleration is about 2.6, when the drone did not move on the ground.  
However, the drone can take off vertically without error when using    
make px4_sitl gazebo  
Drone (please complete the following information):  
- Describe the type of drone: IRIS  
- Photo of the IMU / autopilot setup if possible.  PX4  
Additional context  
Ubuntu 18.04    
Melodic    
newest version PX4-autopilot
