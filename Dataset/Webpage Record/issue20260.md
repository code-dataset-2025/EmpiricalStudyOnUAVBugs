Describe the bug  
When running takeoff in SITL without QGC running, the plane immediately goes into failsafe, goes into RTL and then crases  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior: (Make sure no QGC is running)  
1.Start plane SITL simulation  
    
```bash     
 make px4_sitl gazebo_plane        
```  
2.Command takeoff  
    
```bash     
 commander takeoff        
```  
Expected behavior  
- Vehicle should either takes off or rejects the takeoff command
