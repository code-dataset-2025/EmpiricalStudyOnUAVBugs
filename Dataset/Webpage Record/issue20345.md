Describe the bug  
My Kakute H7 board is unable to spin up the motors on the drone, if I compile firmware using commit c9441bb on the master branch. It appears that the old DSHOT_CONFIG parameter has been replaced with PWM_MAIN_FUNCx and PWM_MAIN_TIMx.  
Reverting to Stable release v1.13.0 eliminates the issue. I can see DSHOT_CONFIG again, and setting it to any value apart from 0 lets me spin up the motors.  
To Reproduce  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Build firmware using latest master  
2.Do basic setup, and test the motors in the Actuators tab  
Expected behavior  
Setting PWM_MAIN_FUNCx and PWM_MAIN_TIMx correctly allows motors to be spun up.  
On older firmware dshot status in the Nuttx shell gives the following:  
    
```bash     
 NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-10.2.0        
nsh> dshot status

```  
On current firmware the following section is missing from the output:  
    
```bash     
 INFO  [mixer_module] Mixer loaded: yes        
INFO  [mixer_module] Driver instance: 0        
```

The implementation and parameters changed, can you follow https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/actuators.html for the setup?

@bkueng Thanks for the quick response. I've attempted following the new setup guide, however I experienced the following:  
- Identify & assign motors is not working even after after I set PWM_MAIN_TIM0 and TIM1 to a DShot protocol. Clicking the button doesn't make them spin.  
- The Actuator Testing sliders don't work either.  
- With the new mixer, commands like dshot beep1 etc don't make noises  
- I can't see a setting to switch between MAIN and AUX PWM outputs for driving the motors.    
My Kakute H7 is a V1.2 if that helps.

Did you reboot? Do the ESC's initialize? What is the output of dshot status?

In my case, while testing KakuteH7v2, vehicle_angular_velocity was not started which meant that dshot output was not frequent enough and therefore the ESCs didn't initialize.  
This fixed it for me: \\\#20873
