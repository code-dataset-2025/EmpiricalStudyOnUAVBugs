Recently with SITL I see this error output on startup:  
    
```bash     
         
ERROR [land_detector] Timed out while waiting for thread to start        
INFO  [mavlink] mode: Normal, data rate: 4000000 B/s on udp port 14570 remote port 14550

INFO  [mavlink] MAVLink only on localhost (set param MAV_BROADCAST = 1 to enable network)

```  
To reproduce:  
    
```bash     
 make px4_sitl jmavsim        
```  
@dagar any idea?

Hi @julianoes  and @dagar , I think I have it fixed in PR \\\#12209 at the schedule call here.  Let me know if that works for you.  
(NOTE: 8ecb925)    
(NOTE 2: The error came from the wait_until_running() call and returned here.)

One last thought, changing from the present ScheduleOnInterval() call to ScheduleNow() preserves the previous behavior prior to the general work queue, so this should be a safe change when it is accomplished: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/53aa4130a8cc549887106b077aae2f77bcacf662/src/modules/land_detector/LandDetector.cpp\\\#L69  
EDIT Updates: ScheduleNow()required a (missing) ScheduleDelayed()  I've flight tested that fix. in PR \\\#12209 .

@dagar , adding a ScheduleNow() call allows the ModuleBase::wait_until_running() call to succeed.  
This means that _object.load() doesn't pass unless ScheduleNow() gets called.  Do you see what's going on there?
