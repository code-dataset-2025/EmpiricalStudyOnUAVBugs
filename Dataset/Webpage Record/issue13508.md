Describe the bug    
EKF gps hgt timeout - reset to baro problem.    
It basically says GPS data is lagged because _gps_hgt_intermittent flag is on.  
_gps_hgt_intermittent = !((_time_last_imu - gps_init.time_us) < 2 * GPS_MAX_INTERVAL);  
However, it seems very difficult to meet this condition unless otherwise GPS has unstable connection. But it's not. It seems some timing issue.
