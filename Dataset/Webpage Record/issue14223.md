Describe the bug    
If a vehicle has two GPS modules connected and the main one fails while it has a higher fix type than the secondary GPS the EKF will not switch to only use the secondary GPS but stop fusing GPS completely.  
To Reproduce    
Collect a replay logfile with a vehicle using two GPS modules. Stop publishing of the first GPS module when it has a higher fix than the secondary GPS  
Expected behavior    
The EKF should switch to only use the secondary GPS  
Additional context    
https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/f3fefd7d9372ec98d404e2e99da2e251114a2d7e/src/modules/ekf2/ekf2_main.cpp\\\#L953-L988  
The problem is that _gps_state[0].fix_type is never updated after the GPS failure so _gps_select_index will never be set to one

It also happens the other way around, and even if the GPS modules have the same fix type
