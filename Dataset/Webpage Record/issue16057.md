Describe the bug    
When we are performing a VTOL transition with a tailsitter type drone We are getting very weird thrust fluctuations. It seems that it's taking two references basically at the same time, I would assume from the MC and FW controllers.    
Also in simulation we don't get this issue.  
More over @xdwgood also reported this issue on PX4 slack, thus proving that this issue is on upstream PX4 and not custom software.  
To Reproduce    
Use a VTOL Tailsitter type drone and perform a transition.  
Expected behavior    
The thrust reference should be smooth during transition.

Additional context    
@xdwgood reported that setting MPC_USE_HTE to 0, i.e. disabling the hover throttle estimator, seems to solve the issue. It's still to be confirmed but I'm still creating this issue to keep track of the problem as it should be fixed entirely.  
@sfuhrer @RomanBapst  FYI

I would also like to add that in my case it seems to be related to MPC_THR_MIN. changing this value seems to change the value of the "clipping" that is happening with the thrust during transition.  
It could still be related to the proposed cause above however. I haven't looked much into it.

It's the same situation for me

@RicardoM17 In your log, the solution of HTE is never declared valid, so I don't think the value itself is doing anything    
I'll check if setting MPC_USE_HTE to 1 makes other undesired effects, even if the estimate is never valid

To me, it actually looks that the issue is in the "blending logic" of MC and FW as it seems to toggle between two values

The two logs don't seem to have the same firmware version (the 1st one doesn't have the validity flag of HTE) and the issue actually looks different to me. Below is a screenshot of the 1st log, and above was the 2nd one:

I'm building on top of 1.10,  i haven't had this issue in my test flights.    
i need to use more powerful motors, i played with the one i had.

@yuthikasagarage   your log shows that the hovering throttle has not worked, so you are normal  
If you can use the new version for testing, I will appreciate you ‚ù§Ô∏è

@bresch  Thank you for your reply, the second log has made minor changes based on this commit„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ    
0b0d23e  
Regarding the second log, I also noticed that the effective value of the thrust estimate is 0, but I think this is weird. Why does the thrust estimate start to release some values only during transmission? I think this is abnormal.  
    
„ÄÄI would also like to add that in my case it seems to be related to MPC_THR_MIN. changing this value seems to change the value of the "clipping" that is happening with the thrust during transition.    
It's the same situation for me. Based on this, I suspect that we are the same problem

After disabling the use of the airspeed sensor, I found this problem again in the simulation

This is a normal log (in flight simulation)  
This is a flight log with errors  
Note: vehicle_attitude_setpoint_0.thrust_body[2]  x  -1  
Under normal circumstances, these three values should be equal, so the problem may occur in local.thrust[2]

Good catch. Is it maybe related due to the tailsitter doing its rotation by 90 degrees?

This was my original guess.

Could be. I don't think it would also be the first time üòÖ

Now I almost locked the problem. This problem only occurs when transmission in manual(log 2 mode)/stabilized(log 1 mode) mode. This is because there are two places inside the program that publish the same information.(One is the smoothed manual.z, and the other is the thrust required to keep the speed equal to zero)

https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/master/src/modules/mc_pos_control/MulticopterPositionControl.cpp\\\#L443  
In my opinion, pilot control should be followed in manual mode, even during transmission. @sfuhrer @bresch  Any suggestions?

Could well be. Can you check how it looks like with this commit cherry-picked: 99dbdb7 . It disables the transition flight task for tailsitters in manual mode.

```bash     
 			// publish attitude setpoint        
			// It's important to publish also when disarmed otheriwse the attitude setpoint stays uninitialized.        
			// Not publishing when not running a flight task        
			// in stabilized mode attitude setpoints get ignored        
			// in offboard with attitude setpoints they come from MAVLink directly        
			if ((_vehicle_status.nav_state == vehicle_status_s::NAVIGATION_STATE_MANUAL ||        
			_vehicle_status.nav_state == vehicle_status_s::NAVIGATION_STATE_STAB) &&        
			_vehicle_status.in_transition_mode) {        
			} else {        
				_vehicle_attitude_setpoint_pub.publish(attitude_setpoint);        
			}        
```  
I added the above code, below is the log before and after the change (simulation flight test)

@sfuhrer  For me, just adding this _control_mode.flag_control_altitude_enabled condition is enough, and add some necessary notes

@RicardoM17 this should be fixed with \\\#16244 right? Please re-open if not.

This is correct.  
Thanks for closing the issue.
