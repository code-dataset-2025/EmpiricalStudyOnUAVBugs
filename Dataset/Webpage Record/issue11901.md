Describe the bug  
If fastrtpsgen is in the PATH (and FASTRTPSGEN_DIR is not set), then the build fails with:  
    
generate_microRTPS_bridge.py: error: argument -f/--fastrtpsgen-dir: expected one argument    
while the generate_microRTPS_bridge.py autodetects properly the presence of fastrtpsgen.  
To Reproduce  
1.Have fastrtpsgen in the PATH and FASTRTPSGEN_DIR not set.  
2.Run make px4_fmu-v3_rtps  
Expected behavior  
The Firmware builds.  
Additional context  
This is due to the option --fastrtpsgen-dir to be set to FASTRTPSGEN_DIR in the CMakeLists.txt. Therefore if FASTRTPSGEN_DIR is not set, argparse fails.

If the line is commented generate_microRTPS_bridge.py succeeds.

This needs a condition here where it checks if FASTRTPSGEN_DIR is set and if not, looks on the default path. Will add that asap.

I have another solution, allowing no data for argparse, using nargs='?'. This is a very small diff as well.
