Describe the bug    
RTL is trigered in FW flight because timeout for heading in MC triggers, sending this messages:    
[navigator] unable to reach heading within timeout    
[commander] Mission cannot be completed  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:    
Firmware: Tailsitter v1.11.3.  
1.Set MIS_YAW_TMT to a value lower than the time to turn 180 degree in FW flight.    
In mi case I had MIS_YAW_TMT set to 1.  
2.Fly a mision with several alt loiters  
You wil get a RTL with this messages:    
[navigator] unable to reach heading within timeout    
[commander] Mission cannot be completed  
Seems that this error is triggered here:    
https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/release/1.11/src/modules/navigator/mission_block.cpp\\\#L398  
Expected behavior    
Ignore the time out since is FW flight.    
Whould be nice also improve the description of MIS_YAW_TMT in the parameter reference, is not clear what a value of 0 does.    
Whould be also nice to be able to ignore the transition heading in a mision for VTOLs with a parameter.

I wasn't able to reproduce, so seems to have been fixed in the mean time.
