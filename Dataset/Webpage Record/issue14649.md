Describe the bug    
i have an couple sensors that i can calibrate, but the calibration disappears after a reboot. i traced the problem back to the function "param_modify_on_import" which modifies the perfectly good parameters CAL_XXX_ID and causes the problem. my guess is that it's related to \\\#14572?  
To Reproduce  
1.calibrate e.g. mpu9250 gyroscope  
2.restart px4, or reload parameters  
3.watch how CAL_GYRO0_ID gets changed  
Expected behavior    
if "param_modify_on_import" does not change these parameters, then the calibration does not dissapear.
