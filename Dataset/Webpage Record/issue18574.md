To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Start SITL with a plane model  
    
```bash     
 make px4_sitl gazebo_plane        
```  
2.Start mission with a takeoff waypoint

Seems that we need to reduce the threshold for thr fixed wing models in Gazebo. @bresch what do you say,

What does vehicle_imu_status.var_accel look like in that log?

@bresch Here is one: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=15f471bd-2a86-4855-9206-ce111cd0b393 ðŸ˜€  
This happens very reliably (every SITL run)

@Jaeyoung-Lim It's apparently because of the high horizontal acceleration when the pusher starts  
We could  
1.increase the threshold (quick fix)  
2.make the detector less sensitive to quick changes (better)
