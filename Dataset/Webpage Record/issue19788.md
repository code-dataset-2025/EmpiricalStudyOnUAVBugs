Describe the bug  
I have tried to use valgrind together with the sitl simulator to check the code.  
To Reproduce  
Simply add the following code into any module's main loop:  
    
```bash     
   int a[3];        
  int i=10;        
  a[i] = 5;        
  a[i]--;        
  printf("%d\n",a[i]);        
```  
Expected behavior  
The valgrind should detect a memory access violation type error.    
However, it reports nothing.

Sorry, forget valgrind cannot check stack arrays.
