One of the problems to solve is this: PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic@3e5fed0\\\#diff-0020558d0aae9f87a3eabf04651b92582eb94089e78c860d631c8a693b523923R90. So we need to make sure that the sensor rotation is correct: PX4/PX4-SITL_gazebo-classic@3e5fed0\\\#diff-0020558d0aae9f87a3eabf04651b92582eb94089e78c860d631c8a693b523923L89. But this doesn't seem to solve everything. Even after applying the previous rotation, I cannot get the vehicle to takeoff and I get continuous ERROR [simulator] poll timeout 0, 22 messages.    
@julianoes are you able to fly the tailsitter with a code base previous to the above PR?

@TSC21 You probably need to do a make clean in between since the messages need to be regenerated?

ERROR [simulator] poll timeout 0, 22 messages.    
This looks like an unrelated lockstep issue.

Yep - it was the fact that I had mavlink-router running in the background. Maybe some loopbacks were being introduced or so. All good now.
