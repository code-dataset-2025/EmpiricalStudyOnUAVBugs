Describe the bug    
An incorrect value of MPC_THR_HOVER will get passed unconstrained to the manual thrust setpoint.  In 1.8.2 the manual thrust setpoint was constrained between MPC_THR_MIN and MPC_THR_MAX.  If the user entered a MPC_THR_HOVER of 50 instead of 0.50 a centered stick would result in a thrust setpoint of 50 where the mixer expects values between 0 and 1.0.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:    
Set MPC_THR_HOVER to a value of 59 (instead of the correct 0.59).  In QGC this is would have to be entered as 5900 but in a startup script as 59.  
Expected behavior    
The hover thrust setpoint should not be greater than 1.0, or MPC_THR_MAX

Yeah, this was a dumb mistake on my part to fat finger the entry, but in 1.8.2 I would have to fat finger two separate parameters.  It's up to you guys if you want to protect against this kind of dumb.
