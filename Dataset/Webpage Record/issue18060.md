Describe the bug    
After the v1.12.1 release the airspeed sensor cannot be calibrated if using UAVCAN sensors. I have 4 pcs pixhawk4 mini's with GPS from Holybro. One has an analog airspeed sensor from Holybro. One has the digital version connected via UAVCAN : https://docs.avionicsanonymous.com/devices/microadc\\\#configuration.  
A few days ago I decided that all the 4 would need firmware upgrade, resetting parameters to have them all with the same parameters. This worked fine until I connected this digital UAVCAN airspeed sensor, now I couldn't calibrate the sensor. I simply got the message and error „No airspeed sensor found“.  
After reviewing all parameters over and over again, and updating the firmware once again, believing that this was a problem on my end. A fellow college suggested that I tried the firmware version that I had before. I installed stable release v1.11.3 and I could do this without any problems.  
I would like to add that I could read the airspeed sensor, just not calibrate it.  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1.Pixhawk4 mini fw upgrade to v1.12.1 (i tried px4_fmu-v5_fixedwing.px4) and px4_fmu-v5_default.px4)  
2.Have an airspeed sensor connected via UAVCAN  
3.Press calibrate and a moment later it says: "No airspeed sensor found". see screenshot.  
I would like to add if not clear, that nothing more is connected to the PX4 mini, I'm using those computers for measuring using the sensors and this seemed the best sensor with respect to price.  
Hope this is clear,    
best regards

Thanks for reporting, I actually didn't realize any UAVCAN airspeed sensors were readily available for purchase.  
Let me see if I can fill in what's missing.

Can you capture the output of uavcan status?

@joibgbg123 are you getting airspeed directly from UAVCAN or differential pressure?  
In addition to uavcan status can you grab listener airspeed and listener differential_pressure?

I will acquire those command-screenshots when I get back to work on Monday morning (GMT).    
The airspeed sensor is giving differential pressure, since the PX4 is reported to like better to calculate the airspeed given the correct differential pressure.  
I actually used the command status while debugging myself, I forgot to include a screenshot of that. This command showed that the UAVCAN is talking the a differential pressure sensor, so I had a node id for a differential pressure, and no info for airspeed(Since the Pixhawk thinks none exists). The parameters are sent to the sensor to publish only raw pressure difference apposed to fully calculated airspeed.    
And like I mentioned in the original post, I can read values in the "Mavlink Inspector" tab for airspeed. Which is calculated onboard the Pixhawk from read values of differential pressure acquired from the sensor.

I am also interested into solving this issue. If you have any pointers were I can start let me know.

I have been looking into this, but it seems it could be solved on multiple ways. Is there any proposed method?  
First time I am diving into PX4 drivers, so could be missing an obvious way.

I found the problem, the calibration is not being handled by uavcan differential pressure.  
This won't be a problem after \\\#15853 comes in, but let me see about a short term immediate fix we can get in for v1.12.2.

I have the same issue with the orange cube and differentialpressure sensor Mateksys ASPD-DLVR.    
Is there any short term fix for this problem yet?
