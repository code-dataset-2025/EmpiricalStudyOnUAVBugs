Describe the bug    
When I used tailsitter to fly, I found that sometimes(Sometimes it can enter successfully, in the same flight) even if I switch, vtoll can not enter the fw mode  
To Reproduce  
1.use master branch fly(tailsitter vtol)  
2.in altitude mode and try transmission(mc to fw)  
3.The drone pitch angle has not changed, there is no tilt acceleration  
Expected behavior    
Every time a customer uses a stick for transmission, vtol should enter the transmission state correctly

Additional context    
I found that fw to mc sometimes fails when I try to send a transfer command using the remote control. I will do some investigations to see where the problem is. I now suspect  
numerical calculations under certain extreme conditions? (eg:at the start of transmission, the actual/setpoint angle of pitch are both 0)  
here: https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/src/modules/vtol_att_control/tailsitter.cpp\\\#L206-L218  
Because I compared the two switches, the only difference I found was that the drone angle/setpoint angle was close to 0 before the failed transmission started

@xdwgood Did I understand correct, that the issue is this spike in the transition switch log?  
Edit: having had a second look it's now clear what you mean üëç I'll have a look

The calculated tilt sometimes has problems. I checked it using the PX4_ISFINITE(tilt) function and found this problem.

No setpoint value is generated when the value check fails(8)
