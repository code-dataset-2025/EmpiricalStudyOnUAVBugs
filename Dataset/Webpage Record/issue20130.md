What are you actually trying to do with none_iris? I've been gradually trying to untangle a lot of this stuff that didn't really make sense to me.  
Now in the main branch you can simply run the PX4 binary directly if you want.  
    
```bash     
 $ make px4_sitl_default      
$ ./build/px4_sitl_default/bin/px4

Thanks! @dagar I was able to run the binaries, as you say.    
Now i'm configuring QgroundControl to run the simulation (I'm searching how to pass the calibration of the sensor).  
I started using AirSim and the tutorial use that command to comunicate Sim<-> px4.
