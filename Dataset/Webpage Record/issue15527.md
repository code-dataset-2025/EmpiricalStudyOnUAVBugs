Describe the bug    
IO doesn´t start and gets no firmware  
To Reproduce    
Steps to reproduce the behavior:    
\\\#15521 solved perfectly the issues about booting and usb-mavlink    
pwm out starts only with sys_use-io = 0  
Expected behavior    
8 pwm out are available with sys_use_io = 1

@taileron do you have the safety button connected? If so, please try powering on the board with the safety button held to force the px4io upgrade.

Pins are not yet soldered but I can manually connect the contacts (safe w 3V3) and this message is a little more specific so I guess that even a forced firmware update does not work:

MTD cannot be activated yet , as it is not absolutely necessary if an SD is available. Should I try to find out if the M25V02 on the F777 is connected to the same SPI pins as the X2.1 for completeness, or is there an exact schematic for X2.1-777 available?

Tried to flash io with St-Link V2 by SWD. Which bin file is the right one? As soon as px4_io-v2.bin from build/external/build is flashed the whole fc doesn´t boot any more it only starts to boot again if a standard px4io_bl.bin bootloader is flashed afterwards. But still no FC communication to IO.

8 PWM outs, Spektrum rc input and wifi telemetry 1 are now working but after each changed main firmware the io has additional to be flashed by SWD (pressing safety sw doesn´t force io flash at boot).    
standard px4io_bl bootloader, master from august 2020 was flashed before.    
QGC allows only to flash PX4 firmware from custom file.
