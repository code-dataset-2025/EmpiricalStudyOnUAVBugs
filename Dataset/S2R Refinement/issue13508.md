Hereâ€™s the extracted report based on the given format for the issue titled **EKF gps hgt timeout - reset to baro #13508**:

---

**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** FMUv5
- **Software environment:** PX4 Autopilot
- **Report Time:** Nov 18, 2019
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Not mentioned
- **last commit before the reporting time:**a172c3c

---

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Encounter an environment where GPS data lags, possibly due to timing issues.
- **Step 2:** Observe the `_gps_hgt_intermittent` flag being set to `true`.
- **Step 3:** Monitor the condition `_gps_hgt_intermittent = !((_time_last_imu - gps_init.time_us) < 2 * GPS_MAX_INTERVAL)`.

---

**Observed behavior by the user:**

- **Behavior after step 1:** The GPS height intermittency flag `_gps_hgt_intermittent` is activated despite a seemingly stable GPS connection.
- **Behavior after step 2:** EKF switches to barometric altitude (`reset to baro`), leading to GPS data being disregarded.
- **Behavior after step 3:** Issue appears difficult to reproduce, but a timing-related inconsistency is suspected.

---

**Expected behavior:**

- **Expected behavior 1:** The GPS connection should remain stable without triggering the `_gps_hgt_intermittent` flag unless there is an actual issue.
- **Expected behavior 2:** EKF should not reset to barometric altitude unless GPS data is genuinely unstable.
