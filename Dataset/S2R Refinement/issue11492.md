**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** Pixhack v5 with an external i2c compass (HMC5883)/GPS combo<font color='red'>Âç≥CUAV v5</font>
- **Software environment:** PX4 Autopilot version 1.8.2
- **Report Time:** Feb 18, 2019
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Not mentioned
- **last commit before the reporting time:**18f7ee2

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Power on the drone with the HMC5883 external compass running.
- **Step 2:** Quickly and repeatedly short the SDA line to ground.

**Observed behavior by the user:**

- **Behavior after step 1:** External compass running normally.
- **Behavior after step 2:** System locks up, no serial communication, and RGB LED freezes.

**Expected behavior:**

- **Expected behavior 1:** I2C should be robust enough to handle an interruption on the SDA line mid-message, avoiding system deadlock.

**Additional information provided by the user for bug investigation:**

- **Actions taken by the user:** 
  - Provided logic analyzer screenshots and details.
  - Attempted tests to interrupt the SDA line mid-message on multiple occasions.
  - Reported different behavior with various versions and branches.

- **URL of the flight log provided by the user:** Not provided. Logic analyzer screenshots were shared via image links.
