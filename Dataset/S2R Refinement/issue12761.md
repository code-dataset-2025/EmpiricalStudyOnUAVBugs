**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** Not explicitly mentioned
- **Software environment:** PX4 Autopilot
- **Report Time:** Aug 21, 2019
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Not mentioned
- **last commit before the reporting time:**950dbc1

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Set GF_ACTION to Hold (Loiter).
- **Step 2:** Upload a geofence to the drone.
- **Step 3:** Takeoff, click somewhere outside the geofence (or inside if it's a keep-out fence) and select "Go to location".
- **Step 4:** Observe the drone violating the geofence and continuing to the destination position.

**Observed behavior by the user:**
- **Behavior after step 1:** N/A
- **Behavior after step 2:** N/A
- **Behavior after step 3:** Drone is commanded to go to a location outside the geofence.
- **Behavior after step 4:** Drone violates the geofence and continues to the destination position despite GF_ACTION set to Hold.

**Expected behavior:**
- **Expected behavior 1:** The drone must reposition to the closest location on the geofence border.
- **Expected behavior 2:** The drone should not continue to a commanded location outside the geofence even if it's already in Hold/Loiter mode.

**Additional information provided by the user for bug investigation:**
- **Actions taken by the user:** User confirmed reproducibility using SITL (Software In The Loop).
