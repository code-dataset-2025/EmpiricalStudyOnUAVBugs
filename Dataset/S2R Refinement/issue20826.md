**Environment where the bug occurred:**

- **Hardware environment:** Not explicitly mentioned
- **Software environment:** PX4 Autopilot running on Ubuntu 20.04 with Ignition Gazebo Fortress
- **Report Time:** Dec 23, 2022
- **PX4 Autopilot commit version:** Not mentioned
- **last commit before the reporting time:**bb591c6

**Steps for bug reproduction:**

- **Step 1:** Run the command `make px4_sitl gz_x500` as described in the PX4 documentation for running simulations with Ignition Gazebo.
- **Step 2:** Use QGroundControl (QGC) to command a takeoff for the vehicle.

**Observed behavior by the user:**

- **Behavior after step 1:** The simulation environment initializes, but there are error messages in the terminal output, specifically: `[Err] [MulticopterMotorModel.cc:253] Please specify a robotNamespace.`
- **Behavior after step 2:** The vehicle does not take off from the ground as expected.

**Expected behavior:**

- **Expected behavior 1:** The vehicle should take off.
- **Expected behavior 2:** After takeoff, the vehicle should go into hold mode.

**Additional information provided by the user for bug investigation:**

- **Actions taken by the user:** The user provided detailed terminal logs, including warnings and errors encountered during the launch of the simulation.
- **Version of Ignition Gazebo:** 6.12.0 was initially being used before updating.

**Communication between developers or other personnel and the user:**

- **Suggestion 1 provided by developers or other personnel:** `bperseghetti` suggested that the version might need to be updated and checked terminal logs for motor topic subscriptions.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 1:** `Jaeyoung-Lim` confirmed that updating manually to the package `libignition-6-dev` version 6.13.0 resolved the takeoff issue.
- **Suggestion 2 provided by developers or other personnel:** A suggestion to check whether Fortress was built from source and if the system was fully updated with the latest binaries.
- **Result of the operation after the user adopted suggestion 2:** Not explicitly mentioned in the report, but the problem was resolved after the manual update of the relevant package version.
- **Additional suggestions** included re-adding a script to prevent such issues and suggested opening a new issue if new problems arise, indicated by `Jaeyoung-Lim` in response to `MichaelBosello`.
